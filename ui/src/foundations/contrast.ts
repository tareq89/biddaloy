/**
 * WCAG 2.2 relative-luminance / contrast-ratio math — a fork of
 * `scripts/check-contrast.mjs`'s own implementation, not an import of it.
 * That script is a standalone CI entry point (`node
 * --experimental-strip-types scripts/check-contrast.mjs`) with top-level
 * `process.exit` side effects and Node-only `fs`/`path` reads, so importing
 * it into a browser bundle would drag those in and likely just crash
 * Storybook's Vite build. This file is the same ~15-line maths, nothing
 * else, so `colors.stories.tsx` can compute a real ratio at render time
 * instead of printing a pre-baked number out of `CONTRAST_PAIRS`.
 *
 * `contrast.spec.ts` asserts this fork agrees with the script on every pair
 * `CONTRAST_PAIRS` already lists, so the two cannot silently drift apart.

 * Expands CSS shorthand hex (`#fff`) to the six-digit form the rest of this
 * file (and `check-contrast.mjs`) expects. Needed only for
 * `useComputedVar`'s live browser reads: `tailwind.preset.ts` and
 * `globals.css` always write six-digit hex, but Storybook's production
 * build minifies the compiled CSS, and Vite's CSS minifier losslessly
 * shortens `#ffffff` to `#fff` wherever it can — so `getComputedStyle`
 * hands back the shorthand form even though nothing in this repo's own
 * source ever wrote it. Values that are already six digits, or aren't hex
 * at all, pass through unchanged; `relativeLuminance` below still rejects
 * anything that isn't a valid hex colour after this step.
