# Message log

Every message the school sent, in one place: to whom, when, how, who sent it, and whether it arrived.

App (push) notifications are not in this log. It is not a record of those.

**Where to go:** in the left menu, **Communications → Message log**. It works on a computer or a phone ([On a phone](#task-phone)).
**Before you start:** be an Admin, Accountant or Office staff ([who can do what](#roles)).

## How you get here <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu:** **Communications → Message log**.

**From search:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K) type "Message log" and choose it. How search works: [Finding any page](../start/find-anything.md).

**From a student or guardian page:** on a student's page, **Messages** is in the **More actions** (⋯) menu at the top; on a guardian's page it is a **Messages** button at the top. The log opens with that person's messages only ([One student's or guardian's messages](#task-scoped)).

**From the dashboard:** on the **Failed messages** widget, press **See which ones**. The log opens with the failed SMS of the last 7 days.

## Find a message and see its details <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

On the demo and staging sites nothing is really sent: the messages land in the **test inbox** (see [Where do codes and messages go on the demo?](../start/sign-in.md#task-test-inbox)).

1. In the left menu press **Communications**, then press **Message log**.

   → The **Message log** opens: **Every message the school sent, newest first.** Columns: **Recipient**, **Sent**, **Channel**, **Mobile or email**, **Kind**, **Company**, **Status**, **Why it failed**.

2. In **Search** type the recipient's name, phone number or email. A phone number can be in any form: `01712345678`, `+880 1712-345678` or `8801712345678`.

   → The list shows only the messages that match.

3. Press **View message** on a row.

   → The **Message details** window opens: **Recipient**, **Mobile or email**, **Channel**, **Status**, **Kind**, **Sent by**, **Sent**, **Company**, **Company's message ID**, **SMS parts**, **Reminder round**, **Why it failed**, and the whole **Message** at the bottom. An email also shows its **Subject**. A value the message does not have shows **—**.

4. If the message belongs to a round of reminders, press **Open the round**. The round's page opens ([Reminder history](reminder-history.md)).

## What the statuses mean <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

| Status        | Meaning                                                                                       | What next                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Queued**    | Still waiting to be sent                                                                      | Wait                                    |
| **Sent**      | The SMS or email company has taken the message; whether it reached the phone is not known yet | If you can, [check status](#task-check) |
| **Delivered** | The company says the message reached the phone                                                | Nothing more to do                      |
| **Failed**    | It did not go, or the company says it did not arrive; the reason is in **Why it failed**      | Fix the reason and send again           |

**Kind** says where the message came from: **Sent by staff**, **Reminder (one)**, **Reminder round**, **Automatic**, **Sign-in codes**, **Exam result** or **Arrival notice**.

What **Message** never shows:

- A **Sign-in codes** message never shows the code or link; the log keeps only the rest of the text.
- An invoice link (the receipt after a payment, or **Send to guardian** on a receipt) shows as `…/i/••••••`. The guardian got the working link; the log never shows it, because anyone with the link can open the invoice for 30 days.
- An **Exam result** message shows **Not shown: only staff who can see exam results can read this message.** to an Accountant. Admin and Office staff see it.

This page does not keep anything on your phone or computer, so there is no "saved on this device" state.

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Ask the company for the status <a href="#task-check" id="task-check"></a>

**Check status** shows only when the message is **Sent**, has a company message ID, and the company that sent it can report delivery (today: OneCodeSoft). On the demo and staging sites it does not show.

1. Press **View message** on the message.
2. Press **Check status**.

   → The button says **Checking…**. When the answer comes, **Status updated.** shows and **Status** changes to **Delivered** or **Failed**. If the company does not know yet, it stays **Sent**.

> **Remember:** one message can be checked once a minute. Pressing sooner shows **The delivery status of this message cannot be checked now.**

### Narrow the list with filters <a href="#task-filter" id="task-filter"></a>

Above the list: **Search**, **Channel**, **Status**, **How it was sent**, **Sent by**, **Company**, and **Sent** (**Sent from**, **Sent to**). The filters are kept in the page address, so a link you share opens the same list.

**Sent by** lists the school's staff who sent at least one message (by name, the first 100).

Example: to find the SMS sent to a guardian last Tuesday, type their number in **Search**, choose **SMS** in **Channel**, and give that day in **Sent**.

### One student's or guardian's messages <a href="#task-scoped" id="task-scoped"></a>

Pressing **Messages** on a student's or guardian's page shows only that person's messages. The top says **Showing messages for one student.** or **Showing messages for one guardian.**

Every filter and **Check status** work here too, on that person's messages only. **Clear all** keeps the view on that person. Press **Show all messages** to go back to every message.

### The **Test** mark <a href="#task-test" id="task-test"></a>

A test message sent from **Settings › Communication** shows a **Test** mark next to **Status** in its details. It is a real message; for SMS it uses credit.

### On a phone <a href="#task-phone" id="task-phone"></a>

On a phone each message is a card: the recipient and the **Sent** time at the top, **Status** on the right, the other columns under them, and **View message** at the bottom of the card.

1. **Search** stays at the top. For the other filters press **Filters** (it shows a number when some are set, such as **Filters (2)**).

   → A sheet opens with every filter. The list changes as you choose.

2. Press **Show … results** at the bottom of the sheet.

   → The sheet closes and the list shows.

| **Why it failed**: **Sending by … is not set up for this school. …**                   | An Admin turns it on in **Settings › Communication**, then send again.             | Admin        |

## Who can do what <a href="#roles" id="roles"></a>

| Role                                                             | See the log | Check status |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Admin                                                            | Yes         | Yes          |
| Accountant                                                       | Yes         | Yes          |
| Office staff                                                     | Yes         | Yes          |
| Academic coordinator, Teacher, Exam controller, Committee member | No          | No           |

**Admin, Accountant and Office staff:** all three see every message of the school and every filter. One difference: an Accountant does not see the text of an **Exam result** message.

For the other roles, **Message log** is not in the left menu.

<figure>
  <img src="diagrams/communications-message-log-overview.svg" alt="A message is Queued, then Sent or Failed; Check status asks the company about a Sent message: delivered makes it Delivered, not delivered makes it Failed, not known yet keeps it Sent; once a minute" width="720">
  <figcaption><em>The status of one message</em></figcaption>
</figure>

- **The answer sets the status:** delivered → **Delivered**; not delivered → **Failed**; the company does not know yet → stays **Sent**; the company did not answer → nothing changes.
- **Which company is asked:** the one that sent the message, on the account it was sent from.
- **Once a minute:** the minute's wait starts even when no answer comes.
- **One press, one question:** a fast double press still asks the company once.
