# Reminder history

See every round of fee reminders sent together: who it reached, who it did not, and why.

**Where to go:** in the left menu, **Communications → Reminder History**. Do the work on this page on a computer.
**Before you start:** be an Admin, Accountant or Office staff ([who can do what](#roles)). Rounds come from pressing **Remind many at once** on the [**Fee reminders**](fee-reminders.md#task-bulk) page.

A reminder sent for one student, and a message from [**Send a message**](send-message.md), do not show here; only rounds sent together do.

## See who a round reached <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

On the demo and staging sites nothing is really sent: the messages of a round land in the **test inbox** (see [Where do codes and messages go on the demo?](../start/sign-in.md#task-test-inbox)).

1. In the left menu press **Communications**, then press **Reminder History**.

   → The **Reminder History** list opens: **Every round of reminders sent together, newest first.** Columns: **Name**, **Created**, **Status**, **Recipients**, **Delivered**, **Failed**.

2. Press **View** on a round.

   → The round's page opens. At the top: **Created**, **Recipients**, **Delivered**, **Failed** and the status. Below: **Message that was sent**.

3. Look at the **Who received it** list: **Recipient**, **Channel**, **Mobile or email**, **Status** and **Why it failed**.

   → While the round is **Processing**, the page refreshes by itself again and again. When it ends, a message appears, for example **Reminder round finished: … sent.**

## What the round and message statuses mean <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

**Round status**

| Status               | Meaning                           | What next                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Processing**       | The messages are still being sent | Wait; the page refreshes by itself    |
| **Completed**        | All messages sent, none failed    | Nothing more to do                    |
| **Partially failed** | Some went, some failed            | [Retry the failed](#task-retry)       |
| **Failed**           | None went                         | See the reason, fix it and send again |

**Status of one message** (in the **Who received it** list)

| Status                  | Meaning                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Queued**              | Still waiting to be sent                                   |
| **Sent**                | The SMS or email service has taken the message             |
| **Delivered**, **Read** | Not reported yet: the app does not record delivery reports |
| **Failed**              | It did not go; the reason is in **Why it failed**          |

The **Delivered** number at the top means how many messages the service has taken; reaching the phone is not counted separately.

This page does not keep anything on your phone or computer, so there is no "saved on this device" state.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Retry the failed deliveries <a href="#task-retry" id="task-retry"></a>

When a round has finished and at least one failed, **Retry failed** appears at the top.

1. Press **Retry failed**.

   → The **Retry failed deliveries?** window opens. It shows the name of the new round, for example **Retry of March dues**.

2. Read the warning: **every guardian** of the students whose delivery failed is messaged again, including those whose earlier message was delivered.
3. Press **Retry**.

   → A new round is made and its page opens. The same message, the same channel and the same WhatsApp template go. **{Amount due}** and **{Due month}** are filled in again from the dues on the day of sending.

> **Remember:** there is no preview before a retry, and for SMS credit is used again. If you do not fix the reason for the failure (for example, SMS turned off), it will fail again.

### Who was skipped before sending <a href="#task-skipped" id="task-skipped"></a>

At the bottom of the round's page is **Skipped before sending (…)**. It is grouped by reason, with **… students** beside each. The meaning of each reason is on the [**Fee reminders**](fee-reminders.md#task-skipped) page. If nobody was skipped, it says **No recipients were skipped.**

Nothing was sent to these people, so **Retry failed** does not include them.

### Find a round <a href="#task-find" id="task-find"></a>

In the **Search** box above the list type the round's name. Filter by **Status**, or give dates in **Created**. The filters are kept in the page address.

| A round stays **Processing** for a long time                          | Some messages are still queued. If it stays long, tell the Admin.                      | Admin        |

| Academic coordinator, Teacher, Exam controller, Committee member | No          | No    |

**Admin, Accountant and Office staff:** all three see all the school's rounds, not only their own; there is no difference in the code.

For the other roles, **Reminder History** is not in the left menu.

<figure>
  <img src="diagrams/communications-reminder-history-overview.svg" alt="When a round is sent it is Processing; each message is sent or fails; if all go it is Completed, if none go Failed, if some go Partially failed; if any failed, retrying makes a new round" width="720">
  <figcaption><em>The status of a round</em></figcaption>
</figure>

- **How the status is decided:** it is counted as each message finishes. If none failed, **Completed**; if none went, **Failed**; everything else is **Partially failed**.
- **Retry means a new round:** the old round stays as it was. The new round is sent by student, not by guardian.
- **Refreshing:** the page fetches new data by itself only while the round is **Processing**.

| Which guardian to send to | One guardian of the chosen student. Their phone or email shows below; without one you cannot send.                                                                                                                                          | Yes               |
| How to send               | Send message: SMS, WhatsApp or Email; SMS and WhatsApp go to the guardian’s phone, or the alternate phone if there is none. Fee reminder: starts on each guardian’s preferred channel; pick one to send everyone on that channel this time. | No                |
| Message                   | What to send. For SMS, the characters and the number of SMS it uses show below. In a fee reminder, use the buttons below to put in the name, due amount or month; each guardian gets their real details.                                    | Yes               |
| Who to remind             | Every guardian starts ticked. A guardian who turned notifications off does not get it, even when ticked.                                                                                                                                    | Yes, at least one |
