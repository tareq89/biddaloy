# Fee collection report

See on one page how much money came in, who took it and how it came. Use it at the end of the day to match the cash in hand.

**Where to go:** in the left menu, **Reports → Fee collection report**. It works on a computer or a phone.
**Before you start:** be an Admin, Accountant or Academic coordinator ([who can do what](#roles)). This page is view-only; nothing here changes any money.

The report's money comes from the [payments](../finance/payments.md) taken. When a payment is reversed, it goes into **Reversed** and is taken off the net.

## See and match today's collection <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu press **Reports**, then press **Fee collection report**.

   → The **Fee collection report** opens. **Date range** starts on **Today**. Under the title you see the date · **All methods** · **All collectors**.

2. Look at the three boxes at the top: **Total collected**, **Reversed** and **Net collected**.

   → **Net collected** = **Total collected** minus **Reversed**. This is how much money really came in today.

3. In the **By collector** table, find each staff member's row. Match the **Net** amount with the cash they hold.

   → **Paid out** is cash given back to a family from the student's credit. It is not taken off **Net**; it is shown beside it. So to match the cash in hand, take **Paid out** off **Net** yourself.

4. Look at the other tables: **By payment method** (cash, bKash and so on), **By fee type** and **By day**.

![Fee collection report with the date range, the Total collected, Reversed and Net collected boxes, discounts and credit, and the By payment method and By collector tables](img/collections-report-02-month.png)

> **Remember:** only successful payments are counted. Pending or failed payments are not. A reversed payment shows twice: the original money in **Total collected**, and the refund in **Reversed**.

## How to know the count is right <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

| State                               | How you know                                                           | What next                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Only picked on screen**           | When you change a filter, the numbers change at once; nothing is saved | —                                           |
| **Loaded from the school's system** | The three boxes show money, with no grey placeholder                   | Match it; print or download a CSV if needed |

This page does not keep anything on your phone or computer, so there is no "saved on this device" state. The filters you pick are kept in the page address, so a reload shows the same count.

**If the numbers do not match:** someone may have taken a new payment just now. Reload the page. The numbers are always as of that moment.

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Yesterday, this week, this month or your own dates <a href="#task-range" id="task-range"></a>

1. From **Date range** choose **Yesterday**, **This week**, **This month** or **Custom**.
2. If you choose **Custom**, the **Custom range** box appears. Enter the **From** and **To** dates.

| You choose     | Days covered                            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Today**      | Today only                              |
| **Yesterday**  | Yesterday only                          |
| **This week**  | From this week's Monday up to today     |
| **This month** | From the 1st of this month up to today  |
| **Custom**     | **From** and **To**, both days included |

Days are counted in Bangladesh time, by the date the payment was taken.

### One collector or one method <a href="#task-collector" id="task-collector"></a>

- From **Collector** choose one staff member. The list holds only people who took money in this range.
- From **Method** choose one, such as **Cash** or **bKash**.

→ The whole page, the three boxes and all tables, shows the count for that person or method only. If you choose a method other than cash, **Paid out** stays zero, because credit is paid back in cash.

### Print or download a CSV <a href="#task-export" id="task-export"></a>

- Press **Print**. The browser's print window opens. The filters and buttons are not printed; the title, the dates and all tables are.
- Press **Download CSV**. A file named `collections-report.csv` downloads. It has one row for each payment: Date, Invoice No, Student, Method, Reference, Collector, Amount, Discount, Reversal. The same filters apply. The file opens correctly in Excel, Bangla names included.

> **Remember:** the CSV has students' names. Do not send the file outside the school.

| Teacher, Office staff, Exam controller, Committee member | No              | No            |

**Admin, Accountant and Academic coordinator:** all three see the same page, the same filters and the same tables; there is no difference in the code. The **Collector** list comes from the report itself, so you do not need permission to view the staff list.

**Committee member:** does not get this page, because the CSV has students' names.

For the other roles, **Fee collection report** is not in the left menu.

<summary><strong>How the money is counted</strong> — which payments, which day, what goes in which table</summary>

<figure>
  <img src="diagrams/reports-collections-report-overview.svg" alt="A successful payment goes into total collected, a reversal goes into reversed, net collected is the total minus reversed; pending or failed payments are left out; cash paid out from wallets is shown on the side and is not taken off the net" width="720">
  <figcaption><em>Where the money goes in the report</em></figcaption>
</figure>

- **Which payments:** only this school's successful payments, and reversals. Deleted, pending or failed payments are left out.
- **Which day:** the date the payment was taken, in Bangladesh time. Money taken after 12 midnight goes to the next day.
- **The three boxes and the By day table:** the full amount of the payment.
- **The method and collector tables:** money in hand = payment amount − the part taken from credit + the part kept as credit. So when credit is used, these two tables can add up to less than **Total collected**.
- **The fee type table:** how much was booked for each fee. A reversed payment is not taken off here, and the **Discount** column adds two kinds of discount.
- **Standing discount:** the part of a bill's standing discount that falls on this payment, estimated by the payment's share.
- **Cash paid out from wallets:** cash given to a family from the student's credit. It is not taken off the net; it is shown separately.
