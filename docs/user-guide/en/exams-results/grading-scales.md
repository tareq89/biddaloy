# Setting up grading scales

Set which percentage of marks gives which grade and GPA, for each academic year.

**Where to go:** in the left menu, **Exams & Results → Grading scales**. Do the work on this page on a computer.
**Before you start:** be the school's Admin. The academic year must already exist ([Academic years](../academics/academic-years.md)). If you want a separate scale for one class, that class must exist too ([Classes](../academics/classes.md)).

This page is about **grading scales**. A scale is a set of **grade rows**. Each row has a range of marks (from % to %), a grade and its GPA, for example 80–100% = A+ = 5. Each academic year has one scale for **All classes**. If a class has its own scale, that one applies to that class. When results are processed, the app looks at this scale to set the grades ([Results](results.md)).

## Create a scale and add grades <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu press **Exams & Results**, then press **Grading scales**.

   → The **Grading scales** list opens: **Name**, **Academic year**, **Applies to**, **Grades**. A scale with no grades shows **No grades yet** beside it.

2. Press **Add grading scale** at the top.

   → The **Add grading scale** window opens.

3. In the **Name** box type a name, for example `National curriculum 2026`.
4. Choose the **Academic year**.
5. For **Applies to**, leave **All classes of the year**. If you want a separate scale for just one class, choose that class.
6. Press **Create**.

   → The new scale's page opens. At the top are **Academic year**, **Applies to** and **Grades**. Below is **No grades yet**.

7. Press **Use NCTB grades**. If you would rather build it from scratch, press **Add row**.

   → Seven rows appear: 80–100 A+ (5), 70–79 A (4), 60–69 A- (3.5), 50–59 B (3), 40–49 C (2), 33–39 D (1), and 0–32 F, which is a **Fail grade** and has no GPA. They are not saved yet.

<!-- image pending: scale page after using the NCTB grades: the 0–100% bar completely filled at the top, seven rows below; 1 · bar 2 · list of rows 3 · Save; admin, desktop -->

8. If needed, change a row's **From (%)**, **To (%)**, **Grade**, **GPA** or **Comment (optional)**. To add a new row press **Add row**; the new row starts from the number after the **To (%)** of the last row and ends at 100, and its grade is blank; fix the range and the grade. To remove a row press **Delete row**.

   → The **0 to 100% — which marks get which grade** bar at the top changes straight away. A red part means no grade for those marks; a striped part means two grades cover those marks.

9. When you see **Every mark from 0 to 100 has exactly one grade.** under the bar, press **Save** at the top right.

   → The **Confirm this change?** window opens. For a new scale it says **This scale isn't used in any result yet — nothing will be recalculated.**

10. In the window press **Save**.

    → An extra approval window may appear; finish the check with what it asks for. Then the window closes and the saved rows show on the page.

| What you press in the window | What happens                                                                                    | Saved? |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Save**                     | The rows are saved; processed results that use this scale are recalculated with the new grades. | Yes    |
| **Cancel**                   | Nothing is saved; your changes stay on the screen of the page.                                  | No     |

> **Remember:** no row is saved until you press **Save** in the window. The grade rows are saved all together as a whole, not one by one.

## How to know the scale is saved <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

| State                           | How you know                                                                                                                    | What next      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Changed on screen only**      | **Save** at the top can be pressed; if you try to leave the page, **Leave without saving?** appears                             | Press **Save** |
| **Reached the school's system** | The window closes, **Save** at the top can no longer be pressed, and the **Grades** column in the list shows the number of rows | Done           |

This page does not keep anything separately on your phone or computer, so there is no "saved on this device" state.

**To check:** go back to the **Grading scales** list. If the scale's row shows a number of rows (for example **7 grades**) instead of **No grades yet**, the grades are saved.

**If the window does not close:** read the red message in the window and see [Problems and fixes](#trouble). Your changes stay on the screen.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Change the grades of an earlier scale <a href="#task-edit" id="task-edit"></a>

1. In the **Grading scales** list, in the scale's row press **Edit**.
2. Change the rows, then press **Save** at the top.

   → The **Confirm this change?** window says **… students' results will be recalculated against the new grades.** This number counts only exams whose results are **Processed** but not yet published.

3. In the window press **Save**, then finish the approval.

   → The rows are saved, and those results are recalculated with the new grades.

### Copy to another class or year <a href="#task-copy" id="task-copy"></a>

If you want the same grades for a new year or another class, copy them instead of typing them again.

1. Open the scale you want to copy.
2. At the top press **Copy to another class or year**.

   → The **Copy grading scale** window opens.

3. Choose **To academic year**.
4. Choose **To class**, or leave **All classes**.

   → It says how many grades will be copied. If that year and class already have a scale with grades, a red line says **That class already has grades for this year. Open it to change them.** and nothing is copied.

5. Press **Copy**.

   → The window closes. If that year and class have no scale, a new scale with the same name is created; if they have a scale with no grades, the grades go into it. You can see it in the **Grading scales** list.

If you choose the same year and the same class, nothing is copied, because that is the same scale. A copy needs no approval, because it only puts grades into an empty scale.

### Change a scale used by published results <a href="#task-published" id="task-published"></a>

If an exam's results have been **Published** with this scale, the grades cannot be changed. When you press **Save**, a red box says **Published results already use this scale. Reopen them before you change the grades.**

1. On the [Results](results.md#task-reopen) page, **Reopen** that exam's results.
2. Come back here, change the grades and press **Save**. The results are recalculated with the new grades.
3. On the [Results](results.md) page, **Publish** again.

### Leaving the page without saving <a href="#task-leave" id="task-leave"></a>

| What you press   | What happens                                      | Saved?      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Stay**         | You stay on the page; the changes stay on screen. | No, not yet |
| **Leave anyway** | You leave the page; the changes are lost.         | No          |

## Problems and fixes <a href="#trouble" id="trouble"></a>

| What you see                                                                            | What to do                                                                                                                                                     | Who can help |

| **Failed to create grading scale**                                                      | Check your internet. A year can have only one scale for **All classes**, and a class can have only one scale of its own; if one exists, open it and change it. | Admin        |
| **This scale can't be saved yet:** and a list of reasons below                          | Fix each reason: the lowest row starts at 0 and the highest row ends at 100; no gaps and no mark covered twice. Look at the red and striped parts of the bar.  | Admin        |
| **Some marks have no grade — see the red part of the bar.**                             | Set the ranges of the two neighbouring rows so that the next row's **From (%)** is exactly the number after the previous row's **To (%)**.                     | Admin        |
| **Some marks have two grades — see the striped part of the bar.**                       | Make sure two rows do not cover the same mark, for example 60–69 and 70–79.                                                                                    | Admin        |

| **Couldn't check the grades. Please try again.**                                        | Check your internet. It also appears if a row's **Grade** is blank; write a grade in every row (up to 10 characters).                                          | Admin        |
| **Couldn't save the grade change. Please try again.**                                   | Check your internet, press **Save** again and finish the approval.                                                                                             | Admin        |
| **That class already has grades for this year. Open it to change them.**                | Instead of copying, open that scale and change its grades.                                                                                                     | Admin        |

- **Rounding the percentage:** each subject's percentage is first rounded to a whole number (.5 rounds up), and then the row is matched. For example 79.5% rounds to 80, so it is A+ in the NCTB grades.
- **Fail grade:** a subject that falls in a row with **Fail grade** ticked is failed, and it has no GPA. A subject also gets this fail grade if it scores below the pass mark of any part.
- **When it can be changed:** if results are Processed, changing the grades recalculates those results by itself. Published results do not change; you must reopen the results first.
