# Promoting students

At the end of the year, move a class's students up to the next class in the new academic year. Keep the students who did not pass in the same class. Graduate the students of the last class.

**Where to go:** in the left menu, **Exams & Results → Class promotion**.
**Before you start:** be the school's Admin. At least one exam of the class must have its results **Published** ([Processing and publishing results](results.md)). The new academic year, its classes and sections must already be created ([Creating and managing academic years](../academics/academic-years.md), [Arranging classes, sections and subjects](../academics/classes.md)).

The work has two steps. First a **Draft** promotion list is made. Nothing changes because of it, and you can look at it, change it or delete it as you like. Then, when you press **Finalise**, all the students move to their new classes together.

> **Be careful:** once you press **Finalise**, it cannot be undone. The students' new class, section and roll are set, and the graduates become "Graduated". There is no "undo" button in the app. Check the list well before you finalise.

## How you get to this page <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu**

1. In the left menu press **Exams & Results → Class promotion**. → All the promotion lists are shown. For a new list, see [Make a promotion list and finalise it](#task-main). To open an old list, press **View** on its row.

---

## Make a promotion list and finalise it <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu press **Exams & Results**, then press **Class promotion**.

   → The **Class promotion** page opens. Below the title it says **Move students up to the next class based on their results.**

2. On the right, press **New promotion list**.

   → The **New promotion list** form opens.

3. In the **Current class** box, choose the class you are moving students from, for example "Class 7, 2026".

   → **Next academic year** fills in by itself (the very next academic year), and **Next class** shows the suggested class, for example "Class 8". Beside it is written **Suggested — you can change it.** If there is no class at the next level, it says **Graduate (no target class)**.

4. If you need to, change **Next academic year** or **Next class**.

5. In **Exams to average**, check which exams will be counted. At first, every **published** exam of this class is ticked. Untick the one you do not want to count.

   → If none is ticked, you see **Select at least one exam.**

6. In **How students are placed in sections**, choose **Block** or **Snake** (see the table below).

7. At the bottom, press **Create list**.

   → The page of the draft list opens. At the top is the summary: **Promoted**, **Retained**, **Graduated**, **Changed by hand**, **Problems**. Below it, for every student, **Rank**, **Student**, **Mean GPA**, **Suggested**, **Final decision**, **New section and roll** and **Why changed**. Nothing has changed for any student yet.

![The draft promotion list: 1 the summary badges, 2 the facts, 3 the students' rows, 4 the Final decision box, 5 Update from results, Delete list and Finalise](img/promotion-02-draft.png)

8. Look at the list. To change someone's decision, see [Change one student's decision by hand](#task-override). If there are red **Problems**, fix them first ([Problems and fixes](#trouble)).

9. At the top, press **Finalise** (on the keyboard, Ctrl+Enter).

   → The **Finalise this promotion list?** window opens. It says, for example, **38 promoted, 2 retained, 0 graduated. This cannot be undone.**

10. Check that the numbers match, then press **Finalise** in the window.

    → If any decision was changed by hand, a window for extra approval comes first; finish the check with whatever it asks for. Then the window closes, the list becomes **Finalised**, and it can never be changed again.

| What you pressed in the window | What happens                                                                                | Did the students move?   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Finalise**                   | All students move to their new classes together. If even one has a problem, nobody changes. | Yes, it cannot be undone |
| **Cancel**                     | The window closes. The list stays a draft.                                                  | No                       |

You cannot press **Finalise** in the window while you see the red text **Fix every placement error before finalising.** or **Every override needs a note before finalising.**

**Exactly what changes when you finalise**

| Final decision           | What happens                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Promote**              | Enrolled in the new academic year, in the chosen section of the new class, with a new roll.                                                                                                                           |
| **Promote on condition** | Goes to the new class just like **Promote**; only the list shows it separately.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Retain**               | Enrolled in the new academic year in a class of the same level (for example Class 7 again). In the section with the old section's name if there is one, otherwise in the first section; the roll is added at the end. |
| **Graduate**             | No new enrolment. Both the student and their current enrolment become "Graduated", and it is written in the student's history.                                                                                        |

Also: students who were already in the new section get their roll moved back (after the new ones). A choice of optional subject group carries over if the same subject is in the same group in the new class. Every change is written in the audit log. No SMS or notice is sent to anyone.

---

## How to know the promotion is done <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

Every change to a draft is saved in the school's system at once. But while the list is a draft, no student's class changes.

| State         | How you know                                                                                                       | What next                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Draft**     | The **Status** in the list is **Draft**; the **Finalise** button is at the top                                     | Check and finalise, or delete    |
| **Finalised** | The **Status** is **Finalised**; the facts show **Finalised on**, **Finalised by** (and **Approved by** if needed) | Nothing to do; you can only view |

**To check:** open the page of a promoted student from the [Students](../people/students.md) list. You will see the new class, section and roll.

**If the window does not close:** nothing is half done. Either everyone is promoted, or nobody is. Read the message on the page and see [Problems and fixes](#trouble).

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Change one student's decision by hand <a href="#task-override" id="task-override"></a>

The system suggests: if the student has a result in all the chosen exams and failed none, it is **Promote** (**Graduate** in the last class). Otherwise it is **Retain**. You can change this if you want.

1. In the draft list, in the student's **Final decision** box, choose the new decision: **Promote**, **Retain**, **Graduate** or **Promote on condition**. You can also press P, R or G on the box.

   → A **Changed by hand** mark appears under the box, and the cursor moves to the **Why changed** box.

2. In the **Why changed** box, write the reason, for example "Could not sit the annual exam because of illness; promoted on condition on the guardian's application".

   → If you leave the reason empty, you see **Write why you changed it.** You cannot finalise until you write a reason.

3. If you go back to the suggested decision, the **Changed by hand** mark goes away, and the reason is cleared.

If any decision was changed by hand, extra approval is needed when you finalise. Later, on the student's page, you can see the reason for this change, the year and who changed it. If the sections of the new class are group-based, you can change the group in the **Group** column. You cannot clear a group to leave it empty (**Clearing a group is not yet supported**).

### Update the list when results or students change <a href="#task-refresh" id="task-refresh"></a>

After the draft is made, if a result is processed again, or someone leaves or joins the class, the list is out of date.

1. In the draft list, at the top, press **Update from results**.

   → It shows **Updating…**, and then the list is worked out again.

What an update does:

- The rows of students who left the class are removed, together with any decisions changed by hand.
- Students who newly joined appear in the list.
- For students whose decision was not changed by hand, the suggestion and the decision are set again using the new results.
- Decisions changed by hand, their reasons and the groups stay as they were.

### Delete a draft list <a href="#task-delete" id="task-delete"></a>

1. In the draft list, at the top, press the red **Delete list**.

   → The **Delete this promotion draft?** window says **This removes every entry in the list. This cannot be undone.**

2. Press **Delete**.

   → The list is deleted and you are back on the **Class promotion** page. Nothing changes for any student.

| You pressed | What happens                                                       | Deleted? |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Delete**  | The draft and all its rows are deleted; students stay as they were | Yes      |
| **Cancel**  | Nothing changes                                                    | No       |

Only a draft can be deleted. A **Finalised** list cannot be deleted.

### Graduate the last class <a href="#task-graduate" id="task-graduate"></a>

If the new academic year has no class of the next level (for example after Class 10), the form shows **Graduate (no target class)** in place of **Next class**. Then the suggestion for those who passed is **Graduate**, and **Promote on condition** cannot be chosen. The other steps are the same as above. Those who failed are **Retain**, that is, in the same class again in the new year.

- **Who is in the list:** the students whose enrolment in the current class is active when the list is made.
- **Suggestion:** the student has a result in every chosen exam and failed none → **Promote**. If even one exam has no result for them → **Retain**.
- **Rank:** the higher mean GPA of the chosen exams comes first; if equal, the higher total marks of all the exams comes first. If both are equal, a fixed internal order is used; no two students are given the same rank.
- **Choosing the section** (only for **Promote** and **Promote on condition**), in rank order:
  - **Block:** section A fills first, then B. Example: two sections A and B, 60 students, no capacity set → ranks 1–30 go to A, ranks 31–60 go to B.
  - **Snake:** they take turns like a snake: A, B, B, A, A, B… So every section gets a mix of strong and weak students, evenly.
  - If a section has a capacity, as many students sit there as there are free places, not counting those already enrolled. If there is a section without a capacity, the extra students go there; if there is none, you see **No room in any section**.
  - If any section of the new class has a group, a student sits only in a section of their own group; if none matches, you see **No matching section**.
- **Roll:** in each new section, those who pass get 1, 2, 3… in rank order. The students who were already in that section have their roll moved after the new ones (keeping their earlier order).

<summary><strong>What can be undone and what cannot</strong></summary>

- **Draft:** fully reversible. Change decisions, update, or delete it; nothing changes for any student.
- **Finalising:** all at once, or nothing. If there is any problem, nobody changes.
- **After finalising:** there is no way in the app to cancel a promotion. The list can no longer be changed or deleted, and it cannot be finalised again. The new enrolments, the new rolls, the rolls moved for other students, the carried-over subject choices, the "Graduated" status and the graduation entry in the student's history all stay. To fix one student's mistake, you have to change their class or section separately (how is outside this page; not checked in the app).
- The earlier year's enrolment record is not deleted; for those who were promoted or retained, last year's enrolment stays as it was.

| Field                               | What to enter                                                                                                                                   | Required?                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Next class                          | The class the students move to. It fills in by itself when you pick the current class; you can change it, or choose Graduate for no next class. | No, if one is suggested             |
| Exams to average                    | Tick the published exams to average. The merit order comes from their average GPA. Pick at least one.                                           | Yes, at least one                   |
| How students are placed in sections | Block fills section A in merit order first, then B. Snake takes turns across sections in merit order, so all sections stay even.                | Yes                                 |
| Outcome                             | Promote, Retain, Graduate or Promote on condition for each student. It starts as the system’s suggestion; if you change it, a note is required. | Yes                                 |
| Why changed                         | Why you changed the system’s suggestion for this student. Needed whenever the outcome differs from the suggestion.                              | Yes, when you change the suggestion |
