# Entering and submitting exam marks

Enter the marks for your section and subject in an exam, and submit the marks list when you are done.

**Where to go:** in the left menu, **Exams & Results → Enter marks**. On a phone, press **☰** at the top left to open the menu, then follow the same path. It is not in the row of buttons at the bottom.
**Before you start:** the Admin must have [created the exam](exams.md) and set its subjects and mark parts. If you are a Teacher, you must be assigned as the **Subject teacher** for that subject in that section ([Teaching assignments](../people/teaching-assignments.md)).

This page is about the **marks list**. There is one marks list for each subject in each section of an exam, for example "Section A · Mathematics". Each row is a student, and each column is a mark part of the subject (for example written, multiple choice). A marks list is in one of two states: **Not submitted** (you can type marks) or **Submitted** (view only).

## Enter and submit marks <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu press **Exams & Results**, then press **Enter marks**.

   → The **Marks entry** page opens. At the top it says how many of the marks lists have been submitted, for example "3 of 12 marks lists submitted".

2. In the **Exam** box, choose your exam. Each name looks like "Exam · Class". The first time, the first exam in the list is already chosen.

   → The marks lists appear below: **Section**, **Subject**, **Status**. The lists that are **Not submitted** come first. A Teacher sees only the lists where they can enter marks.

<img src="img/marks-entry-01-list.png" alt="Marks entry page, exam chosen, three marks lists below in the Not submitted state; 1 · Exam box 2 · Status filter 3 · Enter marks; teacher">

3. At the end of the row for the list you want, press **Enter marks**.

   → The **Marks list** opens. At the top are the subject, section, exam and the number of students, and below that **No changes yet**. The head of each column shows the full marks, for example **/ 50**.

4. Type the marks in the first student's cell. Decimals are fine, for example `34.5`. Bangla or English digits both work.

   → If you type more than the full marks, **max …** appears under the cell and that mark is not accepted.

5. Press **Enter**.

   → The cursor moves to the next student's cell in the same column. Finish one column from top to bottom this way.

6. If a student was absent, press **A** while in their cell. If a student is exempt from this part, press **E**.

   → The cell shows **Abs** or **Exm**. If you made a mistake, type a mark in that cell and it becomes a normal mark again.

7. The app saves by itself a moment after each mark you type. You do not have to do anything.

   → The line at the top first says **Saving…**, then **All changes saved · <time>**. A green tick appears beside the name of each student whose cells are all saved.

8. When every cell for every student is filled, press **Submit** at the top right. Or press **Ctrl+Enter** on the keyboard.

   → The **Submit this marks list?** window opens. If any cell is blank, a red line shows how many are blank, and **Submit** cannot be pressed.

9. In the window, press **Submit**.

   → The app first saves any remaining changes, then submits the list. The window closes, and next to the **Submitted** badge at the top it says **Submitted on <time>. Only an admin can reopen it.** The cells can no longer be changed.

![A marks list after submitting: 1 the Submitted badge with the time and the line that only an admin can reopen it, 2 the marks cells](img/marks-entry-04-submitted.png)

| What you press in the window | What happens                                                                                   | Submitted? |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Submit**                   | Any remaining changes are saved, then the list is submitted and closed.                        | Yes        |
| **Cancel**                   | The window closes. The marks you typed stay as they were (they were already saved by the app). | No         |

> **Remember:** marks save by themselves, but the list is not submitted until you press **Submit**. If a list is still not submitted when the Admin goes to process the results, the Admin gets a warning ([Results](results.md)).

---

## How to know the marks are saved and submitted <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

Marks are not kept separately on your phone or computer. If the internet is down, the app keeps trying to send them, but if you close the page, marks that were not sent are lost. So there is no "saved on this device" state here.

| State                           | How you know                                                                                                         | What next                                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Changed on screen only**      | **Saving…** in the line at the top, or in red **… changes not saved — retrying**; a coloured outline around the cell | Wait and check your internet; do not leave the page |
| **Reached the school's system** | **All changes saved · <time>** and a green tick beside the name                                                      | When every cell is done, press **Submit**           |
| **Submitted**                   | The **Submitted** badge and **Submitted on <time>. Only an admin can reopen it.**                                    | Done                                                |

**To check:** leave the page, then open the same list again from **Enter marks**. If your marks show in the cells, they are in the system. After you submit, the submitted count at the top goes up by one.

**If no message appears:** see [Problems and fixes](#trouble). If you keep the page open, marks that are not yet saved are not deleted.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Enter marks on a phone <a href="#task-phone" id="task-phone"></a>

On a small screen like a phone, the marks list shows one student at a time.

1. Do steps 1–3 above in the same way.

   → One student's name, and below it a cell for each mark part. At the top are **Previous**, "**… of …**" and **Next**.

2. Type the marks in each cell. If the student was absent, press **Absent** beside the cell. If exempt, press **Exempt**.
3. Press **Next** to go to the next student.
4. At the very end, press **Submit** at the top, then press **Submit** again in the window.

   → The **Submitted** badge appears, as on a computer.

<img src="img/marks-entry-05-phone.png" alt="The marks list on a phone: one student, Absent and Exempt buttons beside the cell, Previous and Next above the card" width="300">

On a phone, **A**, **E** and **Ctrl+Enter** do not work; use the buttons.

### Reopen a submitted list (Admin only) <a href="#task-reopen" id="task-reopen"></a>

If a mistake is found after a Teacher has submitted, only an Admin can reopen the list.

1. As the Admin, open the submitted marks list (from [the exam's page](exams.md), or press **View marks** if it is in the **Enter marks** list).
2. In the row with the **Submitted** badge, press **Reopen**.

   → No window appears. The list goes back to **Not submitted**, and the cells can be typed in again.

3. The Teacher corrects the marks and presses **Submit** again.

If the results are **Published**, the list cannot be reopened. First [reopen the results](results.md#task-reopen). If the results are **Processed**, changing marks in a reopened list recalculates the whole exam's results by itself.

### Leaving the page before saving finishes <a href="#task-leave" id="task-leave"></a>

If some marks are not saved yet and you try to go to another page inside the app, the **Leave without saving?** window appears.

| What you press   | What happens                                            | Saved?                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Stay**         | You stay on the page; the app keeps trying to save.     | In a moment               |
| **Leave anyway** | You leave the page. Marks that were not saved are lost. | No, only the unsent marks |

### Open a list to view only <a href="#task-view" id="task-view"></a>

The Academic coordinator and the Exam controller can view marks but cannot type them. In their list each row ends with **View marks**. In the open list the cells are grey and there is no **Submit** button.

| Exam      | Which exam you are entering marks for.                                           | Yes                                            |
| Search    | Part of a section or subject name. Only the Admin sees it.                       | No                                             |
| Status    | **All**, **Not submitted** or **Submitted**.                                     | No                                             |
| Mark cell | From 0 up to the full marks, decimals allowed; **A** if absent, **E** if exempt. | Yes — the list cannot be submitted while blank |

**What happens in the calculation:** if a student is absent in any part of a subject, the whole subject counts as **Absent** and the subject is failed. An exempt part is left out of both the marks obtained and the full marks. If a part has a pass mark set, getting less than it fails the whole subject. More in [Results](results.md#more).

</figure>

- Every section and subject of every exam has one marks list. The columns come from the [exam's mark parts](exams.md).
- Almost as soon as you type (in under a second), the app sends the marks together; if that fails, it tries again every little while.
- When every list is submitted, the Admin or the Exam controller processes the [results](results.md). The [grading scale](grading-scales.md) decides which grade the results get.
