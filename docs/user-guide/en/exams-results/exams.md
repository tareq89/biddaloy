# Creating and setting up exams

Add an exam for a class, set the parts and marks of each subject, give a schedule, and follow the exam from marks submission to published results.

**Where to go:** in the left menu, **Exams & Results → Exams**. Do the work on this page on a computer.
**Before you start:** you must be the school Admin or the exam controller ([who can do what](#roles)). The [class](../academics/classes.md) must already exist in the academic year, and the class must already have its [subjects](../academics/classes.md#task-subjects).

Every exam belongs to one class and one academic year, for example the **Half Yearly** of **Class 9** in the year **2026**. Inside an exam, each subject has **parts**, for example Maths has **Written 70** and **MCQ 30**. Teachers enter marks by part. So after you add an exam, you need to set its parts.

## How to reach this page <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu:** press **Exams & Results → Exams**. Start from step 1 below.

**From the search box:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K), type **Create exam from template** and pick it. → The list of exams opens, and the **Add exam** dialog is already open. Start from step 3 below. Search rules: [Finding any page](../start/find-anything.md).

---

## Add an exam <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu, press **Exams & Results → Exams**.

   → At the top is the title **Exams**, with the line "Every exam belongs to one class and one academic year." The list has the columns **Name**, **Class**, **Academic year**, **Kind**, **Status**. At first it shows the exams of all years.

<img src="img/exams-01-list.png" alt="the exam list, with the Add exam button and the academic year and class filters marked, Admin">

2. At the top of the page, press **Add exam**.

   → The **Add exam** dialog opens.

3. In the **Name** field, type the name of the exam, for example `Half Yearly 2026`.

   → If you leave it empty and save, it shows **Name is required.**

4. From **Kind**, pick **Term**, **Monthly**, **Model** or **Other**. **Term** is picked at first.

5. If you like, give a **Mark entry deadline**.

   → Teachers see on their dashboard how many days are left. If you picked a wrong date, press **Clear date**.

6. Pick the **Academic year**, then pick the **Class**. If the list was filtered to a year, that year is already picked.

   → Until a year is picked, the **Class** field says **Pick an academic year first**. If either is missing, it shows **Academic year and class are required.** You cannot change the year or class later, so pick the right ones.

7. If the school has [exam structures](exam-templates.md), the **Start from an exam structure (optional)** field shows. If you pick a structure, the parts are made for you; if you do not want that, keep **No exam structure**.

<img src="img/exams-02-dialog.png" alt="the Add exam dialog, with the name, kind, mark entry deadline, academic year, class and exam structure marked, Admin">

8. Press **Save**.

   → The dialog closes and the new exam appears in the list, with the status **Draft**. If you picked a structure, a message shows at the top, for example **Exam created with 12 parts**.

> **Remember:** without parts, teachers cannot enter marks. If you did not pick a structure, press the exam name now and [set the parts](#task-components).

---

## How to tell the exam was added <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

Exam details are saved only when you are online; they cannot be kept on the device and sent later. So there is no **Saved on this device** state here.

| State                           | How to tell                                                      | What next                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Changed on screen only**      | The dialog is open and filled in, but has not closed             | Press **Save**                    |
| **Reached the school's system** | The dialog has closed and the exam is in the list with **Draft** | [Set the parts](#task-components) |

**To check:** reload the page. If the exam does not show, look at the **Academic year** and **Class** filters at the top.

**If no message comes:** see [Problems and fixes](#trouble). The details you typed are still in the dialog.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Set the parts of a subject <a href="#task-components" id="task-components"></a>

1. In the list, press the name of the exam, then open the **Marks breakdown** tab.

2. In the **Subject** field, pick a subject.

   → The list of that subject's parts: **Name**, **Kind**, **Full marks**, **Pass marks**. Below it is a line like **2 parts · full marks 100**. If there are none, it says **No parts for this subject yet**.

3. In the **Add a part** section, type the **Name**, for example `Written`, and pick the **Kind**.

4. Give the **Full marks**, for example `70`. If you like, give the **Pass marks**, for example `23`.

   → If full marks is empty or zero, it shows **Full marks must be a positive number.** If you pick the kind **Attendance**, the marks fields go away and this shows: **Attendance parts are computed automatically — marks aren't entered for them.**

5. Press **Add**.

   → The part appears in the list. The full marks of an attendance part shows **Derived**.

<img src="img/exams-04-tab1.png" alt="the Marks breakdown tab, with the subject picker, the list of parts and the Add a part section marked, Admin">

**To delete a part:** press **Delete** on its row, then press **Delete** in the **Delete this part?** dialog. There is no button to change a part here; if it is wrong, delete it and add it again.

**Rules:**

- Two parts of one subject cannot have the same name, and there can be only one attendance part.
- Pass marks cannot be more than full marks.
- Once the results are processed (**Processed**), you can add or delete parts; the results are then worked out again by themselves.
- Once the results are **Published**, parts cannot be changed. It says **Results are published. Reopen the results to change the exam parts.**

### Copy parts from somewhere else <a href="#task-copy" id="task-copy"></a>

If the same parts are needed in many subjects, copy them instead of adding them one by one.

1. On the **Marks breakdown** tab, press **Copy from elsewhere**.

   → The **Copy parts** dialog opens. It says nothing is created until you confirm.

2. From **Source**, pick one:
   - **Another subject in this exam**: then pick the **Subject**.
   - **The same subject in a different exam**: pick another **Exam** of the same class and its **Subject**.

3. In **Copy into**, tick one or more subjects.

   → In the **Preview** section, next to each subject it says what will be created, for example **2 to create: Written, MCQ**. What is already there is **Skipped**, with the reason: **a part with this name already exists** or **this subject already has an attendance part**.

4. Press **Copy**. If you change your mind, press **Cancel**.

### Give a schedule <a href="#task-schedule" id="task-schedule"></a>

The [seat plan](seat-plans.md) picks its subjects from the schedule, and the exam routine is printed from it.

1. On the exam page, open the **Schedule** tab.

   → The list has **Subject**, **Date**, **Starts at**, **Ends at**, **Venue**. If there are none, it says **No schedule yet**.

2. In the **Add a subject to the schedule** section, pick the **Subject**. A subject that is already there does not show in the list.

3. Give the **Date**, then the **Starts at** and **Ends at** times.

4. Press **Add**.

   → The subject appears in the list. If another subject is at the same time, a **Time clash** mark shows beside it; this is only a warning and does not stop saving.

You can change the date, time or venue by pressing the cell in the list. To take a subject off, press **Remove from schedule**, then press **Remove** in the **Remove from the schedule?** dialog.

**Rules:** the date must fall inside the exam's academic year, and the start time must be before the end time. If a subject is in a **Published** seat plan, its date and time cannot be changed or removed; first [unpublish](seat-plans.md#task-unpublish) the seat plan. The venue can still be changed.

### Edit an exam <a href="#task-edit" id="task-edit"></a>

1. At the end of the exam's row in the list, press **Edit**. (There is also an **Edit** at the top of the exam page.)

   → The **Edit exam** dialog opens. It has only the **Name**, **Kind** and **Mark entry deadline**; the year and class cannot be changed.

2. Make your changes and press **Save**.

When the results are **Published**, only the name and deadline can be changed; if you change the **Kind**, it does not save and shows **This exam's results are published. Reopen the results before changing its type.**

### Exam states: draft to published <a href="#task-status" id="task-status"></a>

The state is written at the top of the exam page, and beside it are only the buttons for what comes next.

| State         | What it means                                                  | Buttons at the top                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**     | Parts, schedule and marks are being given                      | **Process result**                                   |
| **Processed** | Results worked out from the submitted marks, not yet published | **Result analysis**, **Process again**, **Publish**  |
| **Published** | Results are published; parts are locked                        | **Result analysis**, **Send result SMS**, **Reopen** |

Pressing **Reopen** makes the exam **Processed** again. The full rules for processing, publishing and reopening will be on [the results page](results.md).

### Delete an exam <a href="#task-delete" id="task-delete"></a>

Only a **Draft** exam can be deleted, for example one made by mistake. Once its results have been processed, the exam cannot be deleted; **Reopen** and correct the results instead.

1. Open the exam's page and, at the top, press **Delete exam**.

   → The **Delete this exam?** dialog opens: "The exam, its marks breakdown, schedule and any marks entered are removed. This can't be undone from the app."

2. Press **Delete**.

   → The exam is deleted and the exam list opens.

If **This exam has results. Reopen and correct them instead of deleting the exam.** or **Couldn't delete the exam. Please try again.** appears in the dialog, the exam was not deleted.

### Filter the list <a href="#task-find" id="task-find"></a>

| Field             | What to pick                                                                                                                               |

| **Class**         | One class, or **All classes**. If no year is picked, it says **Pick an academic year first**. If you change the year, the class is cleared |

If nothing matches, it shows **No exams match these filters**, with a **Clear all** button. Filters are only for viewing; they change nothing.

### The exam page: the tabs <a href="#task-detail" id="task-detail"></a>

Press the exam name in the list, or **View**, to open its page. At the top are the name, the state, and the **Class**, **Academic year** and **Type**; once the results are published, the date of **Results published** also shows.

| Tab                 | What is in it                                                                                                                                                                                                |

- Teachers enter [marks](marks-entry.md) by section and subject, using the exam's parts.
- Grade and GPA come from the school's [grading scale](grading-scales.md).
- If the same parts are needed again and again, make an [exam structure](exam-templates.md).
