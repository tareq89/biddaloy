# Attendance reports

See a section's monthly attendance figures, find who is falling behind, and send a reminder if needed.

**Go to:** **Attendance → Attendance reports** in the left menu. Do this on a computer.
**Before you start:** the section must have at least a few days of attendance taken ([Taking attendance](attendance.md)).

A report never writes anything itself. Teachers take attendance every day, and this page only counts it. So if the attendance is wrong, the report is wrong too; fix it in the [Attendance register](attendance-register.md).

## How you get here <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu:** **Attendance → Attendance reports**. The page opens on the **Month summary** tab; start at step 1 below.

**From search:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K) type "Attendance reports" and choose it. How search works: [Finding any page](../start/find-anything.md).

---

## See a section's month <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu press **Attendance**, then **Attendance reports**.

   → Three tabs (or two) across the top: **Month summary**, **Low attendance**, and, for admins when per-period attendance is on, **By subject**. In the middle it says **Pick a section**.

2. In the **Month** box choose the month. The current month is filled in; you can go back up to 12 months.
3. In the **Class** box choose the class, then in the **Section** box the section.

   → One row per student in that section: **Roll**, **Student**, **Present**, **Absent**, **Late**, **Leave**, **Working days**, **Attendance** (a percentage).

![Month summary tab, the month, class and section boxes and one row per student](img/attendance-reports-01.png)

4. To see one student in detail, press **View** at the end of the row. → The [student's page](../people/students.md) opens.

> **Keep in mind:** changing the class empties the section box. Pick the section again.

## How to know the figures are right <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

| What you see                               | What it means                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **—** where the percentage should be       | Not one day was marked for that student this month. This is not 0%.                                                     |
| **Low** next to the percentage             | The percentage is below the number in the **Minimum attendance (%)** box. If the box is empty, the tag does not appear. |
| **No attendance records for this filter.** | The section has no attendance this month. Check that you picked the right month.                                        |

To cross-check the numbers, open the same section and month in the [Attendance register](attendance-register.md). Both pages read the same records.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Find who has low attendance <a href="#task-low" id="task-low"></a>

1. Press the **Low attendance** tab.

   → The list for the whole school appears, with no section needed: students whose attendance this month is below the limit. Each row also shows **Class** and **Section**.

2. To change the limit, type a number in the **Minimum attendance (%)** box, for example `75`. If you leave it empty, the limit set in the school's settings is used.
3. If you like, pick a **Class** or **Section** to shorten the list.

Students with no marked day this month do not appear in this list. If nobody is below the limit it says **Nobody is below the minimum this month**.

![Low attendance tab, the minimum attendance box and the rows marked Low](img/attendance-reports-02.png)

### Send a reminder <a href="#task-reminder" id="task-reminder"></a>

1. In the **Month summary** or **Low attendance** list, press **Send reminder** at the end of the student's row.
2. In the box that opens, read the message and send it.

<!-- unverified: রিমাইন্ডারের ঘরে ঠিক কী লেখা থাকে আর বার্তা কার কাছে যায় (অভিভাবক?) — students/-send-reminder-dialog.tsx পড়া হয়নি -->

Only admins, accountants and office staff see this button ([Who can do what](#roles)).

### Attendance by subject <a href="#task-subjects" id="task-subjects"></a>

When the school turns on per-period attendance under **Settings › Attendance policy**, the **By subject** tab appears, for admins only (the page reads this switch from the school's settings, which only admins can open). Pick a section and a month, and each student's row shows "came / held" for every subject, for example `18/20`. If no period attendance was taken that month it says **No period attendance this month**. How to take period attendance: [Per-period attendance](attendance.md#task-period).

| **Could not load the attendance report.** (teacher) | You can only see sections assigned to you. Choosing another section gives this message. Pick your own.   | Admin (**Teacher assignments**) |
| **No attendance records for this filter.**          | Attendance was not taken that month. Ask the teacher to [take it](attendance.md), or pick another month. | Teacher                         |
| The percentage looks wrong                          | A day's mark is wrong. Correct it in the [Attendance register](attendance-register.md#task-edit).        | Teacher or admin                |

- The percentage counts only marked days. If no day is marked, the percentage is **—**.
- Days when school is closed are not counted in **Working days**.
- If the school has an absence [fine](../help/glossary.md#fine) rule turned on, fines are also counted from the same **Absent** marks in the register.
