# Attendance register

See a section's whole month of attendance laid out like the paper register, print it, and correct several days at once on a computer.

**Go to:** **Attendance → Attendance register** in the left menu. Editing works only on a computer; on a phone you can view.
**Before you start:** students must be enrolled in the section ([Students](../people/students.md)). If you are a teacher, the section must be assigned to you ([Teacher assignments](../people/teaching-assignments.md)).

Daily attendance is taken on the [Taking attendance](attendance.md) page, one register per day. This page lines those days up side by side into one grid for the month: a row per student, a column per day, and totals at the end.

[View the register](#task-main) · [Print it](#task-print) · [Correct several days](#task-edit) · [Problems and fixes](#trouble)

## How you get here <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu:** **Attendance → Attendance register**. It says **No section picked yet**; start at step 1 below.

**From search:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K) type "Attendance register" and choose it. How search works: [Finding any page](../start/find-anything.md).

The bell that marks a guardian waiting for an arrival notice shows only when you take attendance, not in this register: [The bell beside a name](attendance.md#task-bell).

---

## View a month's register <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu press **Attendance**, then **Attendance register**.
2. In the **Class** box choose the class.
3. In the **Section** box choose the section.
4. In the **Month** box choose the month. The current month is filled in.

   → The whole month's grid appears. Each cell holds one letter: **P** = present, **A** = absent, **L** = late, **V** = leave. **—** means school closed, and **·** means not marked. On the right are each student's totals: **Present**, **Absent**, **Late**, **Leave** and **Attendance %**.

![Monthly register, the class, section and month boxes, the letter key and the totals columns](img/attendance-register-01.png)

> **Keep in mind:** **—** where the percentage should be means not one day was marked for that student this month. It is not 0%.

## How to know a correction was saved <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

| State                         | How you can tell                                                                                                  | What next                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Changed on screen only**    | While editing, changed cells look different, and the top says "3 cells changed". You lose them if you leave the page. | Press **Save**.             |
| **Reached the school's system** | The message "Saved 2 days." appears and the register goes back to its normal view.                              | Done.                          |

This page cannot save without internet. If you are offline, fix a single day from the [Taking attendance](attendance.md#task-offline) page instead.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Print the register <a href="#task-print" id="task-print"></a>

1. Pick the class, section and month to open the register.
2. Press **Print** at the top.

   → Your computer's print window opens. Only the grid prints, with its title and the letter key; the menu, filters and buttons do not. Every day of the month is printed.

3. Choose a printer and print, or save as a PDF.

If the section has no students, **Print** cannot be pressed. While you are editing the button is hidden; press **Save** or **Cancel** first.

### Correct several days at once <a href="#task-edit" id="task-edit"></a>

Only admins and teachers can do this, and only on a computer.

1. Open the register and press **Edit** at the top.

   → The top says **Editing**. The cells in the grid can now be changed. A **Reason for correction** box appears alongside.

2. Press the wrong cell, then press a letter on the keyboard: `P` present, `A` absent, `L` late, `E` leave. `Space` switches present and absent. The arrow keys move to the next cell.

   → The top says "3 cells changed". If you change a day that had no register before, it says "The register for … will be created."

3. If you like, write a **Reason for correction**. One reason is saved in the history of every change.
4. Press **Save (3)** (or `Ctrl + S`).

   → The message "Saved 2 days." appears and the register returns to its normal view.

![Editing mode: the Editing line, three changed cells, the Reason for correction box and the Save button](img/attendance-register-02.png)

**Which days can be changed:**

- Nobody can change a future day or a day the school is closed (**—**).
- A teacher can change only their own section, and only days within the school's correction window (usually 2 days). An older day with no register yet can also be filled in for the first time, but at least one student must be marked.
- For days outside the window, or a final register, see [Correcting an old day](#task-old).

**To give up halfway:** press **Cancel** or `Esc`. If anything changed, the app asks **Discard your changes?**; press **Discard** and the changed cells are lost.

### Correcting an old day (admin only) <a href="#task-old" id="task-old"></a>

When you change a day outside the correction window, the top says "… is outside the correction window, so a reason is needed." and the **Reason for correction** box shows a \*.

1. Change the cells as above.
2. In **Reason for correction** write at least 3 letters, for example `Leave as per guardian's letter`.
3. Press **Save**.

If the reason is too short, the box says **Write a reason of at least 3 letters.** Who changed what, and when, is kept in each student's row history ([Fixing an earlier day](attendance.md#task-fix)).

**Effect on fines:** if absence [fines](../help/glossary.md#fine) are turned on, they are counted from the **Absent** marks in the register. So changing an absence shows up in later fine calculations too.

### The register on a phone <a href="#task-phone" id="task-phone"></a>

On a phone, swipe sideways to see the whole grid. There is no edit button; it says "A whole month cannot be edited on a phone. Tap a date to open that day's register." Tapping a date above the grid opens that day's register on the [Taking attendance](attendance.md#task-fix) page.

- One save covers all the days together: if one day has a problem, none of the days are saved.
- The register's numbers and the [Attendance reports](attendance-reports.md) numbers come from the same place.
- A section whose attendance for today is still to do shows on the [Dashboard](../dashboard/dashboard.md) as **Attendance left to take**.
