# Taking attendance

Take your section's attendance, mark late arrivals and leave, and fix mistakes.

**Go to:** **Attendance → Attendance** in the left menu. On a phone, the **Attendance** button at the bottom of the screen.
**Before you start:** at least one section must be assigned to you (an admin does this on the **Teacher assignments** page).

Every section (for example Class 6, section B) has one **register** per day. This page is where you fill it in; the monthly register and the reports are built from it.

[Today's attendance](#task-main) · [Late or on leave](#task-late-leave) · [Fix an earlier day](#task-fix) · [Problems and fixes](#trouble)

## How you get here <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu:** **Attendance → Attendance**. The section list opens; start at step 1 below.

**From the dashboard:** after signing in, the **Attendance left to take** card on the dashboard lists today's sections still to do. Press a name. → That section's register opens directly, on today's date; start at step 3 below.

**From search:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K) type "attendance" and choose **Attendance**. The section list opens.

---

## Take today's attendance <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. In the left menu press **Attendance**, then the inner **Attendance**. On a phone, press **Attendance** at the bottom.

   → Your sections appear. A section still to do says **Not started**.

<figure>
  <img src="img/attendance-01-menu.png" alt="Dashboard: 1 Attendance in the left menu, 2 the Attendance left to take card">
  <figcaption><em>1 · Attendance in the left menu &nbsp; 2 · the dashboard's "Attendance left to take" card also opens a register directly</em></figcaption>
</figure>

2. Press the card of the section you are marking.

   → Every student appears by roll number. Each says **Unmarked**.

3. Press **All present** at the top right.

   → Every student you have not marked yet turns green **Present**. Marks you already set — absent, late or leave — are not changed. Pressed it by mistake? Press **Undo** in the message at the bottom.

4. Press the **name** of each student who did not come today, once.

   → That student turns red **Absent**, and the **Absent** count at the top goes up.

<figure>
  <img src="img/attendance-05-marked.png" alt="After All present, two students marked absent: Absent 2 at the top, and their rows marked">
  <figcaption><em>After step 4: two students absent, Absent 2 in the counts</em></figcaption>
</figure>

5. Before submitting, check the **Absent**, **Late** and **Leave** counts at the top once. Then press **Submit attendance** at the bottom.

   → You see **Attendance saved**, and the app takes you back to the section list.

**On a phone** the same five steps; only the buttons sit elsewhere:

<figure>
  <img src="img/attendance-phone-02-register.png" alt="The register on a phone: 1 All present, 2 a student name, 3 Submit attendance" width="300">
  <figcaption><em>1 · All present &nbsp; 2 · Student name &nbsp; 3 · Submit attendance</em></figcaption>
</figure>

> **Keep in mind:** pressing a name or a button only changes the mark on your screen. Nothing reaches the school's system until you press **Submit attendance**.

---

## How to know the attendance was submitted <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

A mark can be in one of three states. This is how to tell which:

| State                           | How you can tell                                                                                                     | What next                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Changed on screen only**      | The mark is next to the name, but you have not submitted. The marks survive a reload on this device.                 | Press **Submit attendance**.                                               |
| **Saved on this device**        | The message **Saved on device — will sync when back online**, and "1 change waiting to send" at the top of the page. | It is sent by itself once the internet is back — [details](#task-offline). |
| **Reached the school's system** | The message **Attendance saved**, and the section shows **Draft** or **Submitted** in the section list.              | Done.                                                                      |

**To verify:** press the section's card again in the list. If every mark you set is there next to the names, it is in the system.

  <figcaption><em>The section list after submitting: the section is no longer "Not started"</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**No message?** See [Problems and fixes](#trouble). Your marks are not lost.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### When a student is late or on leave <a href="#task-late-leave" id="task-late-leave"></a>

1. On that student's row, press the **status button** on the right (the one that says **Present** or **Unmarked**).

   → A small list opens: **Present**, **Absent**, **Late**, **Leave**.

2. Press **Late** or **Leave**.
3. For **Late**, a **Minutes late** box appears underneath. Type the minutes in Latin digits, for example `15` (0 to 1440). Leave it empty if you don't know.
4. Press outside the list. The right of the row shows a yellow **Late** or a blue **Leave**.
5. Finally press **Submit attendance**. Only when you see **Attendance saved** has the mark reached the system.

<figure>
  <img src="img/attendance-06-late.png" alt="The status list open, Late chosen, and 15 in Minutes late">
  <figcaption><em>The Minutes late box, after choosing Late</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**Leave in advance:** the **Date** box on the section list does not accept a future date. A school can turn on leave-in-advance under **Settings › Attendance policy**; then a future day's register allows only **Leave**, and the top of the register says "Future date — only Leave can be marked ahead of time."

### Submitting before everyone is marked <a href="#task-unmarked" id="task-unmarked"></a>

If anyone still says **Unmarked** when you press **Submit attendance**, the app asks:

<figure>
  <img src="img/attendance-07-unmarked-dialog.png" alt="The question 18 students unmarked: 1 Mark rest present, 2 Submit anyway, 3 Close">
  <figcaption><em>1 · Mark rest present &nbsp; 2 · Submit anyway &nbsp; 3 · Close</em></figcaption>
</figure>

| You press                   | What happens                                                                                                                                                   | Submitted?                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Mark rest present**       | Everyone unmarked becomes **Present**. You are back on the register; press **Submit attendance** again.                                                        | Not yet                            |
| **Submit anyway**           | Only the marked students go to the system. The unmarked ones stay **Unmarked** in the reports — they are not counted as absent. The register stays incomplete. | Yes — you see **Attendance saved** |
| **✕ (Close)** or **Cancel** | Nothing changes. Your marks stay on screen.                                                                                                                    | No                                 |

To mark the remaining students later, see [Fixing an earlier day](#task-fix).

### Fixing an earlier day <a href="#task-fix" id="task-fix"></a>

Within the school's correction window (usually 2 days) you can fix it yourself:

1. On the section list, choose that day in **Date**.
2. Press the section card.
3. Press the name or the **status button** of the student whose mark is wrong, and set it right.
4. Press **Submit attendance**. When you see **Attendance saved**, the correction is in the system.

After the window, the top of the register says "This register is older than 2 days. Ask an administrator to correct it." You can only look at it then; ask an admin to make the change. When an admin changes such a register, a **Why are you changing this register?** box appears; they write a reason of at least 3 characters, which other staff can see. The **⋮** button on each row shows the **History**: who changed what, and when.

<figure>
  <img src="img/attendance-09-old-register.png" alt="A register past the correction window: 1 the message for teachers, 2 the ⋮ button on a row">
  <figcaption><em>1 · The message teachers see after the window &nbsp; 2 · The ⋮ button on a row (History)</em></figcaption>
</figure>

### The bell beside a name <a href="#task-bell" id="task-bell"></a>

A small bell beside a student's name means a guardian has asked to be told when this child arrives. Hold or hover over it to read **Guardian waits for the arrival notice**. Mark the student present as usual; the message goes by itself. The bell is only a reminder. To answer the request, see [Answer arrival notice requests](../academics/my-class.md#task-arrival).

### Per-period attendance <a href="#task-period" id="task-period"></a>

If the school turns on per-period attendance under **Settings › Attendance policy** and the class routine is published, the register shows a tab per period next to **Whole day**. Press your period's tab, then follow the same five steps. Each period's register is submitted separately.

### Attendance without internet <a href="#task-offline" id="task-offline"></a>

Without internet, the submit button says **Save on device**. When you press it:

- You see **Saved on device — will sync when back online**. The attendance is stored only on this phone or computer; it has not reached the school's system yet.
- The top of the page says **You are offline — 1 change waiting to send**.
- Closing the tab or restarting the phone does not lose it. But it is sent only while the app is open: once the internet is back, open the app (on this device) or keep it open.
- When it is sent you see **1 offline change saved.** The **Your changes** panel at the top then says **All your changes are saved.**

**If it is not sent:** if "waiting to send" stays after the internet is back, open the **Your changes** panel.

- **This changed elsewhere while waiting** — someone else has already submitted this register. Choose which version to keep from the panel.
- **This could not be sent after several attempts** — open the register again, check the marks, and press **Submit attendance**. If that fails too, tell an admin.

**If "This register changed" appears:** someone else (for example an admin) submitted this register after you opened it. A list shows only the students whose mark differs between you and them, **Your mark** next to **Current mark**.

- **Keep mine** — your whole register (every student's mark) is submitted over their version. For the students in the list, their mark is discarded.
- **Take theirs** — all your unsubmitted marks are discarded and the register reloads with their version. You can change and submit again afterwards.

It is worth a word with that person about the listed students before you decide.
