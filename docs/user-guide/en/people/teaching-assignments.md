# Giving teachers class and section duties

Decide here who is class teacher of a section, who is assistant class teacher, and who teaches which subject. These duties decide which sections a teacher sees in the app.

**Go to:** **People → Teacher assignments** in the left menu. Do the work on this page on a computer.
**Before you start:** be the school's Admin ([who can do what](#roles)). Classes and sections must already exist ([The order for setting up your school](../admin/setup-order.md)). The teacher must have a **Teacher profile**; if not, first [give a teacher profile](staff.md#task-teacher).

Every section has a **list of duties**. Each row of the list is one teacher and their duty. There are three kinds of duty: **Class teacher**, **Assistant class teacher**, **Subject teacher** (with a subject). On this page you build that list.

[Assign a teacher](#task-main) · [Remove from section](#task-unassign) · [Change the class teacher](#task-replace) · [Problems and fixes](#trouble)

**On this page**

- [Other situations](#other)
  - [Change the class teacher](#task-replace)
  - [Remove from a section](#task-unassign)

## Give a teacher a section <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. Press **People → Teacher assignments** in the left menu.

   → The title **Teacher assignments** at the top, with "Who is class teacher and who teaches what, section by section" below it. Under that is the **Class** field, and a card for each section of that class: **Section A**, **Section B** and so on. The first class is already chosen.

![the Teacher assignments page, with the Class field, section cards, Add teacher button and duty list](img/teaching-assignments-01.png)

2. In **Class**, choose the class whose section you will give a duty in.

   → The cards for that class's sections appear. Each card has the columns **Teacher**, **Duty**, **Subject**. If nobody is there, it says **No one yet** and "No teacher has been given this section yet."

3. On the card of the section you are giving, press **Add teacher**.

   → The **Assign teacher** dialog opens: "Make a teacher this section's class teacher, assistant class teacher or subject teacher."

4. In **Teacher**, choose the teacher.

   → In the list, each name has the employee ID in brackets. Only staff who have a teacher profile appear.

5. In **Assignment type**, choose one: **Class teacher**, **Assistant class teacher** or **Subject teacher**. **Class teacher** is already chosen.

   → If you choose **Subject teacher**, the **Subject** field appears below. For the other two it does not.

6. For **Subject teacher**, choose the subject in **Subject**.

   → The list has only active subjects, with the code beside each name. If you open the page in Bangla, the names are in Bangla.

![the Assign teacher dialog with Subject teacher chosen, four parts](img/teaching-assignments-02.png)

7. Press **Assign** at the bottom of the dialog.

   → The dialog closes and a new row appears in the section card's list. In the list, **Class teacher** comes first, then **Assistant class teacher**, then **Subject teacher**.

> **Remember:** nothing reaches the system until you press **Assign**. If you have typed something and try to close the dialog, the app first asks whether to throw away what you wrote; you can go back and carry on.

If a row went to the wrong section or the wrong teacher, [remove it from the section](#task-unassign) and assign again.

## How to know the duty was given <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

This work does not run without internet. So there is no **Saved on this device** state here.

| State                           | How you can tell                                                           | What next        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Changed on screen only**      | The dialog is open, a teacher and a type are chosen, but it has not closed | Press **Assign** |
| **Reached the school's system** | The dialog has closed and the section's list has a new row for the teacher | Done             |

**To check:** reload the page, choose the same **Class**, and look for the row on the section's card. Or open that teacher's page from [Adding and managing staff](staff.md) and look in the **Teacher assignments** tab.

![the section card, three kinds of row, three parts](img/teaching-assignments-03.png)

**If no message appears:** see [Problems and fixes](#trouble). What you chose in the dialog stays; nothing is lost.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Change the class teacher <a href="#task-replace" id="task-replace"></a>

A section has only one **Class teacher**. If you make someone new the **Class teacher**, the earlier one is removed automatically.

1. On the section's card, press **Add teacher**. Keep **Assignment type** on **Class teacher**.
2. In **Teacher**, choose the new teacher.

   → A warning appears in the dialog: **{name} will be replaced as class teacher**.

3. Press **Assign**.

| You press  | What happens                                                                                                                                    | Saved? |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Assign** | The earlier class teacher loses the class teacher duty of this section; the new person gets it. The earlier person's other duties do not change | Yes    |
| **Cancel** | Nothing changes                                                                                                                                 | No     |

> **Remember:** if you make someone who was **Assistant class teacher** of that section the **Class teacher**, their assistant row goes away and only the class teacher row stays.

### Remove from a section <a href="#task-unassign" id="task-unassign"></a>

1. On the section's card, press **Remove from section** at the end of the teacher's row.

   → The **Remove this teacher?** dialog opens: "{teacher name} will be removed from section {section name}."

2. Press **Remove**.

   → The dialog closes and the row leaves the list. If the teacher has no other duty in that section, it no longer appears in their own list and they lose access to it. To cut access, remove every duty they hold in that section.

| You press  | What happens                                             | Saved? |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Remove** | This one duty goes away; the teacher's other duties stay | Yes    |
| **Cancel** | Nothing changes                                          | No     |

> **Remember:** this does not remove the teacher's profile or their access to the school; only the duty in that section goes.

### See or give all of one teacher's duties <a href="#task-teacher" id="task-teacher"></a>

To see all the classes and sections of one teacher together:

1. Press **People → Staff** in the left menu, then press the teacher's name.

   → Their page opens. If they have a teacher profile, there is a **Teacher assignments** tab.

2. Press the **Teacher assignments** tab.

   → The list "Classes and sections this teacher is assigned to": **Class & section** (shown as "class · section"), **Duty**, **Subject**. If there is nothing, it says **No assignments yet**.

3. To give a new duty, press **Assign**.

   → The **Assign teacher** dialog opens. Here the teacher is already set, so there is no **Teacher** field. Instead you choose **Class** and **Section** (you can choose a section after choosing the class). The rest is as from step 5 above.

4. To remove, press **Remove assignment** at the end of the row, then **Remove** in the dialog.

   → The dialog text: "The teacher will be removed from {class · section}." When it is gone, the row leaves the list. If it does not, it shows **Couldn't remove the assignment. Try again.**

---

## What the teacher sees next <a href="#after" id="after"></a>

When you give a duty, these things change in the teacher's app. They are checked against the code.

| What the teacher does                          | The rule that follows from the duty                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Take attendance](../attendance/attendance.md) | Only the sections given to them                                                                                                                                                |
| See the student list                           | Only the students of their sections. With no duty, the list is empty                                                                                                           |
| Write marks                                    | Only for their subject, as **Subject teacher**. A **Class teacher** and an **Assistant class teacher** can see the marks of every subject of the section but cannot write them |

**One condition:** the duties that count for a teacher are those on a class of the current academic year. (For marks there is one exception: if a class of the previous year has a draft exam, that works too.) The **Class** list on this page does not show the academic year; check first whether a class is of the current year, or the teacher will see nothing even after you give the duty. (Not yet run in the app; taken from the code.)

An Admin gets past all these rules and can see and work on every section.

- Without a duty, a teacher sees no section, even though they are in the staff list.
- When a duty changes, the teacher sees the change when they open a page again; they do not need to do anything.
- Adding staff and giving a teacher profile: [Adding and managing staff](staff.md#more). Many teachers at once: [Adding staff from Excel](staff-import.md).
