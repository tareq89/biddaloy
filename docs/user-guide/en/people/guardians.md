# Viewing guardians, fixing their details and sending invitations

On this page you can see and fix a guardian's details, change which students are linked to a guardian, and send guardians an invitation to join the app.

**Go to:** **People → Guardians** in the left menu. Do the work on this page on a computer.
**Before you start:** the guardian must already be in the list. You cannot add a new guardian here. A guardian is added when you add a student ([Adding students and viewing their details](students.md)). To send invitations, you must be the school's Admin ([who can do what](#roles)).

A **guardian** is a student's father, mother or the person who looks after them. This page holds a list of them. Press a name to open that person's own page. There you see their details, their children, the messages sent to them and the payments for their children. A guardian's **account** is a different thing. With an account, they can sign in to the app and see their child's attendance, fees and messages. Sending an invitation sends them a link to start that account.

## How you get here <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu:** press **People → Guardians**. Start at step 1 below.

**From search:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K) type **Invite guardians** and choose it (only an Admin sees it). → The guardian list opens with the invite dialog already open. Start at step 3 below. How search works: [Finding any page](../start/find-anything.md).

**From the dashboard card "Guardian details missing" (office staff):**

1. On the dashboard, look at the **Guardian details missing** card to see how many guardian records still need work. What the card means: [What the widgets mean](../dashboard/widgets.md).
2. Press the link at the bottom of the card. → The guardian list opens with **Incomplete records only** already chosen in the **Records** box. Then see [Fix incomplete details](#task-incomplete).

**From the setup checklist of a new school (Admin):**

1. In the setup checklist on the dashboard, choose **Invite guardians**. The other steps of setting up a school: [Creating your school and the setup wizard](../admin/create-school.md).
2. → The guardian list opens with the invite dialog already open. Start at step 3 below.

---

## Invite guardians <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

Do this after you add students, so that guardians can sign in to the app. You see a preview before anything is sent, and nothing goes out until you press **Send invitations**.

1. Press **People → Guardians** in the left menu.

   → The **Guardians** title at the top. Below it is the list of guardians: **Name**, **Relationship**, **Phone**, **Preferred channel**, **Linked students**, **Primary contact**.

![guardian list, with the Invite guardians button, the filter row and the list columns](img/guardians-01.png)

2. Press **Invite guardians** at the top of the page. (Only an Admin sees this button.)

   → A dialog opens with the title **Invite guardians**. It says: "Preview who will be invited before sending — nothing is sent until you confirm." The first step is called **Select**.

3. Read the line in the dialog: **Every guardian in this school without an active account will be previewed.** Then press **Preview invitations**.

   → The dialog moves to the second step, **Preview**. It says "{number} guardian(s) will be invited — {number} skipped." Below that are the names of the guardians who will get an invitation, and next to each name the channel it will go by (email or SMS). To see who was skipped, press the "skipped" text; the list opens with the reason next to each person.

![the invitation preview step, with the count of guardians to be invited and the list of skipped guardians](img/guardians-02.png)

4. Check the list. If someone was skipped, see [Why guardians are skipped](#skip-reasons) to understand why.

5. If it looks right, press **Send invitations**.

   → Sending starts. The dialog says "Sending… {queued} of {total} still in progress." When it finishes, the text changes to "Done — {number} sent, {number} failed, {number} skipped." Then press **Close**.

> **Remember:** nothing goes out before you press **Send invitations**. You cannot pick a few guardians in this dialog: every eligible guardian comes into the preview together. If you close the dialog after sending, the work keeps going.

**Which channel the invitation goes by:** by email if the guardian has an email, otherwise by SMS to their phone. The guardian's **Preferred channel** box is not used here. It is for other messages.

**A guardian who already has an account:** if an account with a password already exists with the same email or phone, the guardian gets a join request instead of an invitation. In the preview they are in the invitation list, but they are not counted in the final "sent" number.

### Why guardians are skipped <a href="#skip-reasons" id="skip-reasons"></a>

| What the preview says                                              | What it means                                              | What to do                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No phone or email on file**                                      | There is no address to send the invitation to              | Give a phone or email with [Fix a guardian's details](#task-edit)           |
| **Already has an active account**                                  | They can already sign in to the app                        | Nothing to do                                                               |
| **Already has a pending invitation**                               | The link from the earlier invitation has not expired yet   | Wait for the earlier one                                                    |
| **Phone or email belongs to another account that is not verified** | That address is on someone else's account and not verified | Check the address is right, then use [Fix a guardian's details](#task-edit) |
| **Opted out of notifications**                                     | The guardian has said they do not want messages            | No invitation goes without their permission                                 |

---

## How to know the invitation went out <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

Sending invitations needs the internet. You cannot save this work on a phone or computer and send it later. So there is no **Saved on this device** state here.

| State                           | How you can tell                                                       | What next                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Changed on screen only**      | You can see the preview, but you have not pressed **Send invitations** | Press **Send invitations**                      |
| **Reached the school's system** | You see "Sending…" or "Done — …"                                       | Wait until it says "Done", then press **Close** |

**To check:** press the guardian's name, then open the **Communication History** tab. The row for the message sent shows there: **Date**, **Medium**, **Recipient**, **Status**. The row can take a little while to appear.

**If something failed:** if the result says "{number} failed", check that guardian's email or phone is right. Fix it and send again from the preview. Guardians who already got an invitation will be skipped as "pending invitation", so they will not get a second one.

---

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Search and filter the list <a href="#task-find" id="task-find"></a>

1. Type a name, phone or email in the **Search** box above the guardian list.

   → When you stop typing, the list gets shorter after a moment. If nothing matches, you see **No guardians found**, and below it: "Guardians appear here when you add them with a student."

2. To narrow the list more, use the boxes:

   | Box                       | What to choose                                                                                                                |
   | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Relationship**          | One relationship, for example **Father**. If you choose none, it says **All relationships**                                   |
   | **Preferred channel**     | **SMS**, **WhatsApp**, **Email**, **Phone call** or **Messenger**. If you choose none, it says **All channels**               |
   | **Primary contacts only** | Tick it to see only guardians marked **Primary**                                                                              |
   | **Records**               | Choose **Incomplete records only** to see only guardians with incomplete details. If you choose none, it says **All records** |

3. Press a column name (**Name**) to sort by name.

> **Remember:** filters only change what you see. They do not change anyone's details. The **Relationship** filter has only Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, Grandfather, Grandmother, Uncle, Aunt and Other. If someone typed something else in the relationship box, the list shows it as typed, but this filter does not catch it.

### Fix incomplete details <a href="#task-incomplete" id="task-incomplete"></a>

A guardian's details count as incomplete if the name or relationship is empty, or if both phone and alternate phone are missing. Without a phone, no message can be sent to them.

1. In the **Records** box, choose **Incomplete records only**. (If you came from the dashboard card, this is already chosen.)

   → Only guardians with incomplete details show, and each row has **View**.

2. Press **View** on one row, then follow the steps in [Fix a guardian's details](#task-edit).

3. When you have fixed everyone, open the list again. If the list is empty, it says **No guardians found**.

### Fix a guardian's details <a href="#task-edit" id="task-edit"></a>

1. In the guardian list, press **View** at the end of the name's row.

   → The guardian's page opens. At the top are the name, a **Primary** or **Secondary** mark, and four facts: relationship, phone, preferred channel, and how many students are linked.

2. Press **Edit** at the top of the page.

   → The **Edit guardian** page opens, with eight boxes.

![the Edit guardian page, with the eight boxes and the buttons at the bottom](img/guardians-03.png)

3. Change the box you want to change: **Full name**, **Relationship**, **Phone**, **Email**, **Alternate phone**, **Occupation**, **Preferred channel**, **Address**. Write the phone number in English digits.

   → If you leave **Full name** empty and go on, you see **Full name is required.** If you empty any other box, that detail is deleted.

4. Press **Save changes**.

   → The page closes, and the guardian's page shows the new details.

| You pressed                             | What happens                                                                                                                             | Saved? |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Save changes**                        | The new details are saved and the page closes                                                                                            | Yes    |
| **Cancel** (when nothing was changed)   | Nothing changes and the page closes                                                                                                      | No     |
| **Cancel** (when something was changed) | **Discard your changes?** opens. Press **Discard changes** and the edits are deleted. Press **Keep editing** and you go back to the page | No     |

**A guardian who signs in on their own:** if they have an account, the **Phone** and **Email** boxes cannot be changed. The boxes only show the details, with the note: "This guardian signs in with this phone and email. The parent changes them from their own account, or an admin edits their user." To change a staff member's phone as an Admin, see [Adding and managing staff](staff.md).

> **Remember:** you cannot change the **Primary** or **Secondary** mark from this page.

### Change the linked students <a href="#task-students" id="task-students"></a>

A guardian can have more than one child. Here you decide which student is linked to which guardian.

1. On the guardian's page, open the **Linked Students** tab.

   → The title **Linked students**, and below it: "The students this guardian looks after." The list shows each student's **Name**, **Class**, **Roll**, **Registration number**. If there are none, you see **No students linked yet.**

2. Press **Edit linked students**.

   → A dialog with the same name opens. At the top is the list of linked students now, with **Remove** next to each one. Below it is the **Search students** box.

3. To add a student, type a name or registration number in the box and choose from the results. To remove someone, press **Remove** next to them.

   → If nothing matches, you see **No students found.**

4. Press **Save**.

   → The dialog closes, and the list changes to show the new students.

| You pressed | What happens                                                                            | Saved? |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Save**    | Exactly the students in the list are now linked; anyone you removed is no longer linked | Yes    |
| **Cancel**  | Nothing changes                                                                         | No     |

> **Remember:** **Save** replaces the whole list, not only the changes. So check who you are keeping before you remove anyone. Removing a student does not delete the student or the guardian's details. Only the link goes.

Press **View** on a linked student's row to open that student's page: [Adding students and viewing their details](students.md).

### Record a payment <a href="#task-payment" id="task-payment"></a>

When a guardian pays, you can start recording the payment from the guardian's page. (Only an Admin and an Accountant see this button.)

1. Press [**Record payment**](../finance/record-payment.md) at the top of the guardian's page.

   → The record payment page opens, already set up with this guardian's children. For the other steps, see [the record payment page](../finance/record-payment.md).

2. When the payment is recorded, go back to the guardian's page and open the **Payment History** tab. The new payment is at the top of the list.

### The guardian's page: the tabs <a href="#task-detail" id="task-detail"></a>

At the top of the guardian's page are the name, a **Primary** or **Secondary** mark, and four facts. Below are four tabs:

| Tab                       | What is in it                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Information**           | **Contact details**: phone, alternate phone, email, occupation, preferred channel, address. An empty box shows "—"                        |
| **Linked Students**       | The list of children. You change it from here: [Change the linked students](#task-students)                                               |
| **Communication History** | Messages sent directly to this guardian: **Date**, **Medium**, **Recipient**, **Status**. For viewing only                                |
| **Payment History**       | Payments for any of this guardian's children: **Date**, **Student**, **Amount**, **Method**, **Reference**. Each row has **View payment** |

The **Messages** button at the top (Admin, Accountant, Office staff) opens the [Message log](../communications/message-log.md#task-scoped) with this guardian's messages, where each one can be opened in full.

The tab is part of the page's address, so you can send someone straight to the "Linked Students" tab.

  <figcaption><em>From a student to a guardian's account</em></figcaption>
</figure>

- A guardian is created together with the student. You cannot create a new guardian on this page. You can only fix the details of the guardians who are already there.
- To send messages, the app needs the guardian's phone. That is why details with no phone count as incomplete.
- Once the account is started, the guardian sees their child's attendance, fees and messages in the app. Before that, they only receive messages.
