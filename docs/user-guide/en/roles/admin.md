# Admin

This role sets up the school in the app and keeps it running.

As an Admin you can see and change everything in the school. At the start you set the school up: academic year, classes, sections, staff and students. After that you check the dashboard every day and help others with their work. Only you can approve money-risk actions and cancel payments.

## What you cannot do <a href="#cannot" id="cannot"></a>

- Create a new role or change a role's permissions. A school has seven fixed staff roles. See [Roles and access](../administration/roles.md).
- See another school's data. Every role sees only its own school.
- Platform work, such as closing a school or giving the Super admin role. SchoolManager's own team does this; no school can give this role.
