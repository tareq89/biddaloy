# Academic coordinator

This role gives you one view of teaching, attendance and results across the whole school.

The head of the school (the headmaster or principal) usually gets this role in the app. In the app the role is called **Academic coordinator**. Your day starts on the dashboard, with today's attendance and the approvals that are waiting. You decide on staff leave and applications, look at results and reports, and issue certificates. Taking money or entering marks is not your job.

## Your first day <a href="#first-day" id="first-day"></a>

1. [Sign in](../start/sign-in.md#task-main). The dashboard opens as soon as you are in.
2. [Check today on the dashboard](../dashboard/dashboard.md#task-main). You see what percent of students came today, who is on leave and what approvals are waiting.
3. [Look at the alerts](../dashboard/alerts.md#task-main). For example, a section that has not taken attendance long after it should have.
4. [Open the applications that are waiting](../applications/applications.md#task-main) and decide on them.
5. [Open the attendance reports](../attendance/attendance-reports.md#task-main). You can see which section is falling behind, month by month.
