# Exam controller

This role keeps everything about exams in one pair of hands, from setting them up to publishing results.

As an Exam controller you are busiest in exam season. First you create the exams, make seat plans and print the exam papers. When teachers submit marks, you see who is still left. When all the marks are in, you generate the results and publish them. After you publish, guardians and students see the results in their app.
