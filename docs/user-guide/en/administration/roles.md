# Roles and permissions

Compare what each role in the school can see and do, on one page.

**Go to:** **Administration → Roles & access** in the left menu. View this page on a computer.
**Before you start:** be an Admin. The menu of every other role does not have this page.

Every staff member has one **role**, such as Teacher or Accountant. The role decides what they see and do in the app. This page only shows; there is no button on it, and nothing changes. A person's role is chosen when you add them on the [**Staff**](../people/staff.md#task-main) list.

## See the permissions of one role <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. Press **Administration** in the left menu, then press **Roles & access**.

   → The title **Roles & access** at the top, and below it "What each role can see and do in this school. Read-only." Then seven cards, one for each role: **Admin**, **Accountant**, **Academic coordinator**, **Teacher**, **Exam controller**, **Office staff**, **Committee member**.

2. Find the card of the role you want to see.

   → The card shows the role's name, one line about its work, its data access (for example **Whole school** or **Assigned sections only**) and the total number of permissions, for example **18 permissions** on the Exam controller card.

3. Press a group under the card, for example **Fees (…)**. The number in brackets is how many permissions are in that group.

   → The group opens and every permission in it is shown in plain words. Press it again to close it.

<!-- image pending: Roles & access page; 1 · title and the "Read-only" line 2 · one role card 3 · data access 4 · permission count 5 · one open permission group; admin, desktop -->

> **Remember:** these cards come from the same list the school's system uses to check every action. So what the card says matches what the app allows. A Teacher's permissions still work only inside their own sections.

This page does not save anything, so there is no "was it saved" state to check.

---

## How to know you are on the right card <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

The card has the role's name at the top and a number such as **18 permissions**. When you open a group, the number in brackets after its name equals the number of permissions listed inside it. This page never saves anything, so there is no "saved" message to look for.

---

## Who can do what, in short <a href="#matrix" id="matrix"></a>

The full list is on the cards. Here are the main points.

**Data access.** Every role sees only its own school's data. Nobody can ever see another school's data.

| Role                                                                                                     | How much data they see |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Admin, Accountant, Academic coordinator, Office staff, Exam controller, Committee member                 | Whole school           |
| Teacher                                                                                                  | Assigned sections only |

A teacher sees the students, attendance and marks of only the sections given to them ([**Teacher assignments**](../people/teaching-assignments.md)). If no section is given, the list is empty. If they open the page of someone outside their sections, they get "not found".

**What each role mainly does**

| Role                  | What they can do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | What they cannot do                                                                  |

| Academic coordinator  | View students, results, marks and reports; approve staff leave; view applications and decide on them; run programs; change a student's status (for example left school); issue certificates; send alerts.                                                                    | Take money or generate bills, enter marks, settings                                  |
| Teacher               | In their own sections: take attendance, enter marks, give and view homework, arrange the syllabus, write student notes, write program progress. View their sections' students, guardians and fees.                                                                           | Anything outside their sections, take money, publish results                         |

| Office staff          | View admission applicants, add and edit students and guardians, import from a file, student records, send messages, printing and certificates, view applications and decide at their own step. Only view fees and invoices.                                                  | Take money, delete students, settings                                                |
| Committee member      | View only: dashboard, committee reports, staff evaluations, calendar.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | See student details, change anything                                                 |

Every staff role except Committee member can mark and view their own attendance, and can apply for themselves ([**Applications**](../applications/applications.md)).

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

- **A role you expected is missing:** the school has seven fixed roles. There is no way to add one here.
- **A permission seems missing from a group:** groups only show permissions the role has. A permission the role does not have is not listed.

Opening this page needs the permission to view the staff list, which only the Admin has. If another role opens the address directly, the page does not open; a message appears instead.

  <figcaption><em>How much each role sees</em></figcaption>
</figure>

- **One person, one role:** in one school a staff member has one role.
- **Permissions are checked twice:** the menu shows only the pages you have permission for. If someone opens an address directly, the school's system checks again and blocks the action.
- **Super admin:** this is a platform role that no school can give. So it is not on the cards.
- **Parents and students:** they are not staff. They have their own apps, and they see only their own family or their own information.
