# School website

Set up a public website for your school, see it before anyone else, then publish it.

**Go to:** **Administration → Website** in the left menu. Do this work on a computer.

**Before you start:** be an Admin. Other roles do not see this page ([who can do what](#roles)).

The **website** is the public page of your school, at its own web address. People do not need to log in to read it. Only what you **publish** is visible.

## Set up the website <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. Open **Administration → Website**. If you have no website yet, press **Set up website**.

   → The **Set up your school website** page opens with three steps: **Web address**, **Design**, **Publish**.

2. In **Your web address**, type a short name, for example `greenfield`. Use 3 to 30 English letters, numbers or hyphens. Do not start or end with a hyphen.

   → The page checks it: **This address is free.** or **This address is already used. Try another one.** You can also pick one from **Addresses we suggest**.

3. Press **Next**. Pick a **design**, then **colours**, then a **text style**.
4. Press **Next**. You can add the school logo (optional, JPG, PNG or WebP, under 20 MB). Press **Use this photo** to keep it.
5. Press **Publish and turn on**.

   → **Your website is ready.** The website is on and everyone can see it at its link.

> **Remember:** nothing is public until you press **Publish and turn on** here, or **Publish** on the overview page.

6. Press **Save draft**.
