# Printing ID cards

Print ID cards for one student or staff member, a few, or a whole section; reprint when needed, or revoke a lost card.

**Where to go:** a student's page, **Print ID card**, or the **Students** list. Staff cards come from the **Staff** list or the staff member's page.
**Before you start:** you need a published design for this document type ([Print designs](../print-templates.md)) and at least one printer ([Printers and calibration](printers-and-calibration.md)).

Every printed card is a **copy**: copy 1 the first time, copy 2 when you print again, and so on. Each copy has its own QR code, so revoking one copy makes only that copy invalid.

## Print one person's card <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. Open the student's page ([Students](../../people/students.md)). For a staff member, open the staff page ([Staff](../../people/staff.md)).
2. Press **Print ID card**. The student's **Documents** tab also has this button; there you can add or change the card photo.

   → **Print preview** opens and shows the card with the real name and photo. The default design is chosen.

![Print preview, one student's card front and back, printer chosen](../img/id-cards-01.png)

3. Under **Printer** choose **Choose a printer** ([why you choose it yourself](printers-and-calibration.md#why-printer)).
4. Press **Print**.

   → The browser's print window opens. Print with the same printer, **Margins: None** and **Scale: 100%** ([print window settings](printers-and-calibration.md#browser-settings)).

5. The app asks **Did all 1 cards print correctly?** — press **Yes, all printed**.

   → The message **Recorded.** appears, and you go back to where you started.

> **Remember:** pressing **Print** writes the card into the print history straight away, before any paper comes out. So answer the question at the end, so that the history stays right.

## How to know the card is printed <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

| State                           | How you know                                                   | What next          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Only changed on screen**      | The preview shows the card, you have not pressed **Print** yet | Print              |
| **Reached the school's system** | The question **Did all … cards print correctly?** has appeared | Answer it          |
| **Done**                        | The message **Recorded.**; in the history **Printed**          | Hand over the card |

**To check:** find the row in [**Reports → Print & documents**](#history), or scan the card's QR code and see **Valid document** ([Check a card by its QR code](../print-templates.md#qr-check)).

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Several people or a whole section <a href="#many" id="many"></a>

| What you want          | What to do                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A few people           | In the **Students** (or **Staff**) list tick whose cards you need, then press **Print ID cards (n)** at the top |
| A whole section        | In the **Students** list filter by class and section, then press **Print ID cards for whole …**                 |
| Without opening a list | In the **Print ID cards** window choose **Who is it for?**, then **Choose by name** or **Whole section**        |

The preview and printing are then the same as for one person ([Print one person's card](#task-main)).

If a card has a **Check** mark, the list above says **… of … cards need attention**, for example **No photo** or **Text does not fit**. Fix it and come back, or press **Print this round anyway**.

### A big section: printing in rounds <a href="#batches" id="batches"></a>

With many cards the app splits them into **rounds**. The round size comes from the design's **Cards per round** (50 at the start, at most 200). In the preview you can lower **Cards per round**, but not above the design's value.

1. Print the first round.
2. Answer the question:

| You press            | What happens                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Yes, all printed** | The round is recorded and the next round opens                                                                          |
| **Some failed…**     | Tick the cards that did not print correctly and press **Confirm**; then press **Reprint n failed** and only those print |

3. Keep going until all rounds are done. You cannot move to the next round without answering.

> **Remember:** once printing starts, the **Design** can no longer be changed. The whole section prints on one design.

### Reprint a card <a href="#reprint" id="reprint"></a>

If a card is torn or printed wrong:

1. Open the student's **Documents** tab and **Print history**, or open [**Reports → Print & documents**](#history).
2. In the card's row press **Reprint**.

   → A **Reprint …** window opens: **This prints the same card exactly as before, as a new copy with its own QR code.**

3. Choose a **Printer** and press **Print**.

   → The new card gets the next **Copy** number and prints on the same design version as before. If the design has a **Label on reprints** (for example "Copy {n}"), it is printed on the card, so nobody mistakes it for the first card.

The old copy stays valid. For a lost card, first [revoke it](#revoke), then print again. A revoked card cannot be reprinted; print a new card from the student's page.

### See the print history <a href="#history" id="history"></a>

[**Reports → Print & documents**](../../reports/printables.md) → **Print history** tab.

- Columns: **Printed**, **Printed by**, **Document**, **Person**, **Copy**, **Status**.
- Filters: **Document type**, **Design**, **Printed by**, **Date**, **Result**, **Status** (**Valid only** / **Revoked only**), and **Search by name**.
- Press **View** to see exactly what was printed, front and back. The QR code is not stored, so it does not show there.

![Print & documents, Print history tab, a list of Admit card prints with one cancelled row](../img/id-cards-02.png)

### Revoke a lost card <a href="#revoke" id="revoke"></a>

Only an Admin can do this.

1. In **Reports → Print & documents**, in the card's row press **Revoke**.

   → A **Revoke …** window opens: **Anyone scanning this card's QR code will see it is no longer valid.**

2. Write a **Reason**, for example "lost" (required, up to 280 characters; staff see it, the public does not).
3. Press **Revoke card**.

   → The message **Card revoked** appears. The row's status becomes **Revoked**. Scanning the QR code shows **This document has been revoked**.

> **Remember:** a revoke cannot be undone. Only this copy is revoked; the same person's other copies stay valid. Match the **Copy** number to pick the right card.

| Printing a staff card says you have no permission          | A staff card also needs permission to see staff HR details; ask an Admin                                 | Admin        |

To print a staff card you need the print permission and also the permission to see staff HR details; for now only an Admin has both.
