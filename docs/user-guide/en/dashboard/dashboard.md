# Seeing today's work on the dashboard

See on the first page after sign-in what needs your attention today, and go to the right page in one press.

**Go to:** **Dashboard** in the left menu. On a phone, the **☰** menu at the top left ([opening on a phone](../start/phone.md)).
**Before you start:** nothing. The dashboard is already set up for every staff role.

The **dashboard** ([glossary](../help/glossary.md#dashboard)) is a page of **widgets**. A widget is a small card: it holds a number or a short list, and a link to the place where you do that work. Your role decides which widgets you get; a teacher and an accountant do not see the same page.

## How you get here <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the left menu:** press **Dashboard**. Start at step 1 below.

**From search:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K) type "dashboard" and choose it. How search works: [Find any page](../start/find-anything.md).

**From the morning summary notification:**

1. On a school day, a notification arrives on your phone or computer in the morning, saying how many things need your attention today. How to turn it on or off: [Alerts and notifications](alerts.md#task-digest).
2. Press the notification. → The dashboard opens. Start at step 1 below.

---

## See today's work <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. Press **Dashboard** in the left menu.

   → The **Dashboard** title at the top, with today's weekday and date below it. The **Customise** button is on the right.

2. Read the long row just under the title. This is today's summary: how many alerts are open for you.

   → For example **2 urgent · 3 warnings**, with **most urgent: …** below. If there is nothing, it says **Nothing needs you right now.**

<!-- image pending: top of the dashboard, with the summary row and the See all to-do button marked, admin, desktop -->

3. To see the full list, press **See all to-do (n)** on the summary.

   → The **Alerts & notifications** page opens, on the **To-do** tab. What each alert means and what to do: [Alerts and notifications](alerts.md).

4. Scroll down. Look at the number on each widget, and press the link for the work you want to do.

   → The page for that work opens. What each widget means: [What the widgets mean](widgets.md).

<!-- image pending: the whole dashboard, the grid of widgets, admin, desktop -->

> **Keep in mind:** the dashboard only shows. Pressing something here changes no data; the work happens on the page the link opens.

To change the order or which widgets show: [Customising the dashboard](customise.md).

## How to know the dashboard loaded properly <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

This page saves nothing. Each widget loads on its own, so you can tell the state of one widget like this:

| State                   | How you can tell                                           | What next                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loading**             | A grey empty box where the card will be                    | Wait a moment.                                             |
| **Showing old figures** | **Showing the last saved figures.** at the top of the card | New figures arrive by themselves when you are back online. |
| **Did not load**        | **This widget could not load.** and a **Try again** button | Press **Try again**. The other widgets are fine.           |
| **All good**            | You can see the number, the short sentence and the link    | Done.                                                      |

**If no message appears:** see [Problems and fixes](#trouble). Even if the dashboard does not appear, none of your data is lost.

## Other situations <a href="#other" id="other"></a>

### Dashboard by role <a href="#task-roles" id="task-roles"></a>

If you have more than one role, you see the dashboard of the role you are in now.

In a new school where not one setup step is done yet, the admin first sees only the setup list. What the steps are: [How everything in the school fits together](../admin/how-it-works.md) and [The order to set up your school](../admin/setup-order.md).

### The committee member's dashboard <a href="#task-committee" id="task-committee"></a>

A committee member does not see today's summary like the others. On their page:

- Under the title, the month and academic year instead of the date.
- A line just under the title: **For the committee: totals only, no personal details**.
- At the top, a **Print monthly meeting report** button. How to print the report: [Customising the dashboard → Monthly meeting report](customise.md#task-committee-report).

<!-- image pending: the committee member's dashboard, with the Print monthly meeting report button, committee member, desktop -->

The whole role in one place: [Committee member](../roles/committee.md).

### The dashboard on a phone <a href="#task-phone" id="task-phone"></a>

On a phone the widgets are the same, just laid out differently:

1. At the top, **Key numbers**: small tiles in two columns. A widget that shows only a single number becomes a small tile here. Pressing a tile that has no link opens the whole widget; press again to close it.
2. Below that, the other widgets, one under another, in a compact size.
3. The **Customise** button is on the phone too.

Which widgets become tiles on a phone is written next to each name in the role list above.

<!-- image pending: the teacher's dashboard, the key-number tiles, teacher, phone -->

### The guardian's Overview page <a href="#task-portal" id="task-portal"></a>

The guardian's app has no dashboard. Instead it has an **Overview** page with a few fixed cards; these cannot be rearranged:

- Today's row: whether each child is at school today, for example **At school today** or **Attendance not taken yet**.
- **This month's attendance**
- **Due this month** (fees)
- **Today's homework**
- **Latest result**
- **Next holiday**
