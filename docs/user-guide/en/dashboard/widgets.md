# What the widgets mean

What each dashboard widget says, where its number comes from, and what to do after you read it.

**Go to:** **Dashboard** in the left menu, then find the name of the widget you want to understand in the list below.
**Before you start:** nothing.

A **widget** is one card on the dashboard. Each card has a name at the top, a big number or a short list in the middle, and below it a one-line sentence and a link. What the dashboard itself is: [Seeing today's work on the dashboard](dashboard.md).

[Read a widget](#task-main) · [All the widgets](#task-list) · [Problems and fixes](#trouble)

**On this page**

- [How you get here](#arrive)
- [Read a widget](#task-main)
- [How to know the number is right](#confirm)
- [Other situations](#other)
  - [All the widgets, one by one](#task-list)
- [Problems and fixes](#trouble)
- [Who can do what](#roles)
- [Learn more](#more)

---

## How you get here <a href="#arrive" id="arrive"></a>

**From the dashboard:** in the role list of [Seeing today's work on the dashboard](dashboard.md#task-roles), press the name of a widget. → This page opens, at that widget's section.

**From search:** in the search box at the top (Ctrl+K) type the widget's name.

---

## Read a widget <a href="#task-main" id="task-main"></a>

1. Read the widget's **name**. For example **Student attendance today**.
2. Look at the big **number**. This is the main news.
3. Read the **sentence** below. It says whether the number is good or bad, or higher or lower than before.
4. If there is something to do, press the **link**.

   → The page where that work is done opens.

![one widget card, 1 name 2 number 3 sentence 4 link](img/widgets-01.png)

In the list below, each widget has three lines:

- **What it means** — exactly what the number counts.
- **Where the number comes from** — which work, on which page.
- **What to do** — the next step after you look.

> **Keep in mind:** a widget only shows. To change a number, go to the page the link opens and do the work there.

---

## How to know the number is right <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

A widget saves nothing. But you can tell whether the number is fresh or old like this:

| State                   | How you can tell                                           | What next                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Showing old figures** | **Showing the last saved figures.** at the top of the card | New figures arrive by themselves when you are back online. |
| **Did not load**        | **This widget could not load.**                            | Press **Try again**.                                       |
| **All good**            | You can see the number, the sentence and the link          | If you still doubt it, check on the linked page.           |

**If no message appears:** see [Problems and fixes](#trouble).
