# School website (Epic 40)

Every school can have a public website at `<school>.<root domain>` (for example `bmsc-high.schoolmanagerp.com`),
or at its own domain. The school edits a **draft** in the admin app and **publishes** it. The public site shows only
the published copy.

Wave 1 (this page) covers the database, the by-host API, the `site/` container and the edge. The admin screens,
blog, enquiries, gallery and results come in later waves and add to this page.

## Request flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  V[Visitor browser] --> CF[Cloudflare]
  CF -->|"*.root, tunnel"| N["nginx :8081<br/>site.conf.template"]
  N -->|"30 s micro-cache"| S["site container (Astro SSR)<br/>site/"]
  S -->|"GET /api/v1/public/site/by-host/HOST/..."| API[NestJS API<br/>modules/website/public]
  API --> R[(Redis cache)]
  API --> P[(Postgres)]
  API --> O[(Object storage<br/>pictures)]
  N -->|"/media/*"| API
```

The site container is anonymous: no cookie ever reaches it, and no tenant id is sent. The API reads the school from
the `Host` name only.

## Publish

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Admin app
  participant API as /website API
  participant DB as school_sites
  participant R as Redis
  A->>API: PUT /website/draft { config, draft_revision }
  API->>DB: update where draft_revision = N (else 409 site.stale)
  A->>API: POST /website/publish { version, draft_revision } + Idempotency-Key
  API->>DB: published = draft, version + 1 (only if both numbers still match, else 409 site.stale)
  API->>R: delete the feed keys of this school
  Note over R: Content keys carry the version, so the old ones simply stop being read
```

Example body: `PUT /api/v1/website/draft` with `{"config": {...}, "draft_revision": 3}`. A save from a stale tab, or a
publish of a draft nobody on that screen has seen, answers 409 `site.stale`.

## Host to school

| Host the visitor typed                                       | Looked up in                                                              | Answer                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bmsc-high.<root>`                                           | `school_sites.subdomain`                                                  | The site                                      |
| `old-name.<root>` (renamed < 30 days)                        | `school_sites.previous_subdomain` until `previous_until`                  | 301 to the new subdomain                      |
| `www.myschool.edu.bd`                                        | `school_sites.custom_domain`, only when `custom_domain_status = 'ACTIVE'` | The site                                      |
| anything else, off site, nothing published, suspended school | n/a                                                                       | One identical 404 (`site.not_found`, Rule 23) |

Subdomains are 3 to 30 characters (`SITE_SUBDOMAIN_RE`); `RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS` in `shared` lists the names no school
may take (`app`, `demo`, `site-test`, ...). Edge limit: the API can resolve an active custom domain, but the site listener (`:8081`) only accepts subdomains of `ROOT_DOMAIN`; any other host gets 444 until the custom-domain edge work (#3646) ships. Direct edge mode does not expose school sites at all.

On staging, `SITE_TEST_HOST` is an always-on custom domain for the demo
school.

## Cache

| What                         | Key                               | TTL                         | Cleared by                                     |

| Manifest and pages (Redis)   | `site:<tenant>:<version>:<kind>`  | 24 h                        | A publish (new `version`, old keys never read) |
| Notice feed (Redis)          | `site:<tenant>:feed:notices`      | 60 s                        | TTL, or publish / switch on-off                |
| Pages (nginx `site_cache`)   | `$host$request_uri`               | 30 s                        | TTL; `?preview=` is never stored               |
| Pictures (nginx and browser) | `/media/<id>` (the id is the key) | 1 day nginx, 1 year browser | Nothing: a new picture gets a new id (D41)     |

## When something is down

| What is down          | What the visitor gets                                                                                                                                    | Why                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Redis                 | The page, built from Postgres. One error log per minute.                                                                                                 | D32, D42: never a 500   |
| API or site container | nginx serves the last good page, even an expired one; if none is cached, `maintenance.html` (503, `Retry-After: 30`), also when the upstream answers 500 | `proxy_cache_use_stale` |
| Postgres              | Same as API down for uncached pages; cached pages still show                                                                                             | D32                     |
| Object storage        | The page; the picture answers the one 404 and the site shows no picture                                                                                  | Rules 23, 24            |

## File map

| Path                                                   | What lives there                                                     |

## SEO

Each school host answers these itself. The site builds them from the by-host read model: no new server route.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  V["Search engine or share card"] --> S["site (Astro SSR)"]
  S -->|"/sitemap.xml /robots.txt /feed.xml /llms.txt /og/home.png"| M{"Host resolved,<br/>not noindex, not preview?"}
  M -->|yes| OK["The file"]
  M -->|no| N["The same 404 body as an unknown host"]
```

| Endpoint            | Answer                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/sitemap.xml`      | Every enabled page that has a route, bn and en, each with `hreflang` alternates        |
| `/robots.txt`       | `Allow: /`, `Disallow: /*?preview=` and the sitemap; `Disallow: /` when noindex/preview |
| `/feed.xml?lang=en` | RSS 2.0 of the blog; 404 when the blog page is switched off                            |
| `/llms.txt`         | A plain-text summary: name, page URLs, recent posts                                    |
| `/og/<page>.png`    | A 1200 x 630 card: palette colour, school name, page title                             |

Each page also carries one canonical, bn/en/`x-default` alternates, Open Graph and Twitter tags, and JSON-LD
(`EducationalOrganization`, `BreadcrumbList`, `NewsArticle` for a post).

- **Noindex.** `school_sites.noindex`, any preview (the `X-Site-Preview` header, a `/website/preview/<theme>/` path, a
  `?preview=<token>` draft) gives `robots: noindex`, no canonical, no JSON-LD and no sitemap, feed, llms or card.
  Only `robots.txt` answers in a header preview (`Disallow: /`).
- **Escaping.** JSON-LD is written with `<` escaped, so no value can close the script tag. XML drops characters XML 1.0
  cannot carry, then escapes the rest.
- **The card has no logo, on purpose.** Drawing it needs no fetch, so nothing a school typed can make the site call out
  (no SSRF), and the work stays small. Cards are cached in memory (200), for one hour.
- **Limit.** The sitemap and RSS list only the 12 newest posts, because the blog feed carries 12. A paged list feed
  would lift it.
- **Fonts.** The card is drawn with the system fonts of the container; the image installs Noto Bengali and Inter, so
  Bengali and Latin text render; text in any other script falls back to whatever is available and may show empty boxes.

## Budgets in CI

| Job (workflow)                        | When                                         | What it checks                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `site-budget` (`ci.yml`)              | When `site/**` or the website module changes | Demo school on the real API, built site, Lighthouse mobile (3G): performance, accessibility, SEO >= 0.9; layout shift <= 0.05; script <= 30 KB |
| `site-themes` (`nightly-quality.yml`) | Nightly                                      | Runs the site e2e, which rewrites `site/e2e/__screenshots__/<theme>/`; the changed files are listed and uploaded                               |

Config: `lighthouserc.site.cjs`. The preview URL is noindex by design, so it has no SEO budget. There is no results
page URL until Epic 70.

Reading a failure: open the `site-reports` artifact (kept 7 days) and the assertion name in the log. Raising a
threshold is a decision, never a CI fix. `site-themes` never fails on a picture diff (fonts differ a little between
runners): read the diff list in the job summary, and commit the new pictures if the change was meant.

## Gallery and video on the site

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[page/home feed: one album, max 12 photos] --> B[GalleryCarousel: 3:2 slides, dots, swipe]
  C[page/gallery feed: every album] --> D[GalleryGrid + viewer dialog]
  E[video section: 11-char YouTube id] --> F[poster + play button] -->|click| G[one sandboxed youtube-nocookie iframe]
```

- Photos are `/media/<mediaId>` (1200x800, 3:2). Captions are bilingual and optional; the image `alt` is the caption, else the album title.
- A gallery section with no photo, and a video section with no valid id, render nothing (D12). The gallery page is a 404 then, and absent from nav and sitemap.
- The carousel logic is one module, `site/src/lib/carousel.ts`, shared by the hero and the gallery. It auto-advances every 6 s, pauses on hover and focus, and never auto-advances under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- The viewer is a native `<dialog>` (Esc closes, Tab stays inside, focus returns to the tile) with arrow keys and swipe. Script: `site/src/islands/gallery-viewer.ts`.
- Video is click-to-play: before the click the page has no iframe and makes no request to YouTube. The island re-checks the id with `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{11}$` before building the URL.
- All seven themes register both sections and style them only through the `--gc-*` and `--ve-*` variables of `basic/theme.css`.

## Backup and restore

`school_site`, `site_posts`, `site_enquiries` and `staff_web_profiles` are workbook tabs. Pictures (`site_media`) are
files in storage, not rows: a restored post or staff card loses its picture link, and a restored config that points at
a picture id keeps the id, which answers 404 until the school uploads it again. `site_media` also has database rows, and the public API needs the matching row, so restoring files alone does not revive old ids. Recovery: upload the picture again in the admin (new id), point the draft at it, publish. A restore never changes the school's
subdomain or custom domain, and only moves `version` / `draft_revision` forward.

## Custom domain and analytics (40.4.08)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> PENDING_DNS: PUT website/custom-domain
  PENDING_DNS --> PENDING_SSL: Cloudflare confirms ownership TXT
  PENDING_SSL --> ACTIVE: certificate issued
  PENDING_DNS --> FAILED: 7 days without progress
  PENDING_SSL --> FAILED: 7 days without progress
  ACTIVE --> [*]: DELETE website/custom-domain
```

A BullMQ job (`site-custom-domain`) asks Cloudflare every 10 minutes about each `PENDING_*` hostname. Only `ACTIVE`
resolves in `SiteHostService`; every other host gets the one 404. Cloudflare unreachable changes nothing (D42).

Example: the school types `www.myschool.edu.bd`; the API answers 202 with two records to add at the registrar:

```text
CNAME  www.myschool.edu.bd                      -> sites.<SITE_ROOT_DOMAIN>
TXT    _cf-custom-hostname.www.myschool.edu.bd  -> <value from Cloudflare>
```

| Env                                 | Meaning                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CF_SAAS_API_TOKEN` + `CF_ZONE_ID`  | Both or neither (boot refuses one). Neither = custom domains off, routes 409. |
| `CF_SAAS_FALLBACK_ORIGIN`           | Default `sites.<SITE_ROOT_DOMAIN>`.                                           |
| `UMAMI_API_URL` + `UMAMI_API_TOKEN` | Both set = first publish creates one Umami site. Unset = no analytics.        |

**Custom hosts only once edge routes them (follow-up).** Today the edge nginx does not send an unknown `Host` to the
site container (Rule 12 answers 444), so an ACTIVE custom domain resolves in the API but a visitor cannot reach it
until a reviewed edge change lands.

Failure and release rules:

- A name is claimed in `school_sites.custom_domain` (unique) before Cloudflare is asked. A lost create answer is
  adopted by looking the hostname up; a claim with no Cloudflare id after 15 minutes is adopted or released.
- A host that FAILS (7 days stuck, or Cloudflare says blocked/moved/deleted) is deleted at Cloudflare and its name
  released, so another school can claim it. The status stays `FAILED` with no host so the school sees why.
- ACTIVE hosts are asked about once a day (inside the same 200 per tick cap).
- Replacing a domain creates the new hostname first, swaps the row, then deletes the old one. A refused replace
  leaves the live domain untouched.
- `PUT` and `DELETE` carry the route throttle plus an hourly per-school cap (20) in Redis, because one Cloudflare
  token serves every school. `PUT` fails closed if Redis is down; `DELETE` fails open.
- A publish that races a status change can answer `site.stale`; the admin screen reloads and retries.

### Not done / follow-ups

- Edge routing of custom hosts (the blocker above), its own reviewed ticket.
- Dangling-CNAME takeover: confirm in Cloudflare's docs whether it validates a CNAME that already points at the
  fallback origin without the ownership TXT.
- Deleting a school should delete its Cloudflare hostname (today only the DB row cascades).
- `Idempotency-Key` does not compare the request body: the same key with another host replays the first answer.
- The three new nullable columns are exempt from the demo seed (see `22-demo-seed.md`).

The server cannot see `EDGE_MODE` (it is an edge container variable), so "direct mode" means the operator leaves the
two Cloudflare values empty. Every refusal (off, malformed, platform name, taken by another school) is one 409
`site.custom_domain_unavailable`; Cloudflare down is 503 `site.custom_domain_try_later`.

## Learning

- **2026-11-07 (W4, 40.4.08).** Cloudflare for SaaS needs: a zone with the fallback origin proxied, a token scoped
  to "SSL and Certificates: Edit" only, and the school's CNAME plus the `_cf-custom-hostname` TXT. An apex needs the
  school's DNS to flatten CNAMEs (D23); otherwise the registrar forwards apex to `www`. Claiming the host in our own
  unique index before asking Cloudflare means two schools racing for one host never create two hostnames.

- **2026-11-07 (W1 close).** Surprise: the draft save and publish take `draft_revision`, not just `version`.
  Cost: tickets written against `{ config, version }` would have sent a body the API refuses. Fix: contract note
  posted on #3624. Rule candidate: a ticket that names an API body copies it from `schema.d.ts`, not from memory.
- **2026-11-07 (W1 close).** Surprise: Postgres `jsonb` stores keys in its own order. Cost: a restore preview showed
  `draft` as changed on an identical config. Fix: the `school_site` tab compares with sorted keys. Rule candidate: any
  tab that compares jsonb sorts keys first.
- **2026-11-07 (W1 close).** Surprise: `demo` and `site-test` are reserved subdomains, so the demo school cannot use
  its own short name. Cost: none, it uses `bmsc-high`. Rule candidate: seed code takes the subdomain from the school
  slug, never from the word "demo".
- **2026-11-07 (W2 close).** Surprise: the server lane (#3622) rejected the `logo` media slot while the wizard
  (#3625) uploaded to it. Cost: each lane's own tests were green; only regenerating `schema.d.ts` and running the
  typecheck exposed the mismatch. Fix: caught at W2 close. Rule candidate: regenerate `schema.d.ts` as soon as each
  server lane lands, so a client lane never builds on a stale contract.
- **2026-11-07 (W2 close).** Surprise: a client type was hand-typed (a `media.url` field) instead of taken from
  `schema.d.ts`; the admin media list has no picture URL. Cost: the wizard preview had to use the blob it just
  uploaded. Fix: preview from the uploaded blob. Rule candidate: client types for an API response come from the
  generated schema, never from memory of the ticket.
- **2026-11-07 (W2 close).** Surprise: a fresh worktree has no built `shared/dist` or `site-themes/dist`, and the
  symlinked main-checkout `node_modules/@biddaloy/*` points at main's stale packages. Cost: server build and
  migrations failed with missing exports until the packages were linked to the worktree and `yarn build:shared`
  and `yarn build:site-themes` ran. Rule candidate: an e2e run in a worktree links `@biddaloy/*` to its own
  packages and builds shared first.
- **2026-11-07 (W3).** Surprise: every wave so far had at least one hand-typed API shape that the server did not
  match (W2 `media.url`; W3 a post `excerpt`, a bare `string[]` of suggestions, enquiry `status`, teacher `name`).
  Cost: one fix round per wave, found only after `schema.d.ts` was regenerated. Fix: client lanes now use generated
  types only. Rule candidate: regenerate `schema.d.ts` the moment a server lane lands, and brief client lanes from it.
- **2026-11-07 (W3).** Surprise: the logo is stored twice. The website screens upload to the `logo` site-media slot,
  the public site served `schools.logo_key`, so a new logo never showed. Cost: found by review, not by any test.
  Fix: `/media/logo` and the manifest prefer the newest site-media logo and fall back to the profile logo; the
  manifest cache key carries the logo row id because uploads do not bump `school_sites.version`. Rule candidate: when
  two places can hold one picture, name which one the public read uses before building the upload.
- **2026-11-07 (W3).** Surprise: one accumulating branch reached 141 files. Cost: it could not become a PR under
  the 100-file cap and could not be rewritten (no force push), so it was rebuilt as three stacked branches. Rule
  candidate: count files after every cherry-pick and cut at about 80, before the branch is pushed.
- **2026-11-07 (W3).** Surprise: a public query parameter (`?classSectionId=`) went straight into a Redis key.
  Cost: caught in review; anyone could have created unbounded keys. Fix: validate and check the school owns it
  before the cache is touched. Rule candidate: nothing a visitor sends becomes a cache key unchecked.
- **2026-11-07 (W3).** Surprise: ticking "Public" on a notice used to mean only "anyone with the link"; it now also
  lists the notice on the school website, and old public notices appear after the first publish. Fix: the field note
  and the guide say both. Rule candidate: renaming a flag's meaning needs the wording and the guide changed together.
- **2026-11-07 (W3).** Surprise: running the integration and e2e suites together on one machine produced only
  timeouts, with a different failing file each run, and every file passed alone. Cost: hours of reruns with no
  signal. Fix: gates run one section at a time in one agent. Rule candidate: record the load average with every gate.

- **2026-11-07 (W4, themes).** Surprise: the mockups were not AA-clean. Cost: every theme needed a contrast pass.
  What changed from the mockups, per theme: Primary darkened its bright primaries; Premium's brass on oxblood failed as
  small text, so brass is for hairlines and large labels; College and Madrasa use their accent colour as decoration
  only, never for text; Premium's display fonts exist in one weight, so no theme asks for a bold the file lacks (fonts
  are one weight per file). Fix: per-theme tokens and the specs in `site-themes/src/*.spec.ts`. Rule candidate: a
  mockup colour is a starting point; run `contrast.mjs` on the real tokens before building on them.
- **2026-11-07 (W4, themes).** Surprise: Astro bundles the CSS of every theme into one page, so one theme's rules
  restyled another. Cost: Primary, High school, International and Premium leaked into each other until fixed. Fix: every
  theme's CSS sits under `.t-<theme>`, and the cross-theme spec in `site/e2e/themes/` guards it. Rule candidate: a new
  theme's selectors all start with its `.t-<theme>` class.
- **2026-11-07 (W4, themes).** Surprise: `--ink-3` failed AA in all themes, and no test noticed; review did. Cost: one
  fix round across seven themes. Fix: darkened per theme, and the per-theme specs now check it. Rule candidate: contrast
  is checked for every text token, not just body and heading.
- **2026-11-07 (W4, custom domain).** Surprise: Cloudflare for SaaS never routes a custom host through our edge, so
  Rule 12 ("the origin is reachable only through the edge") could not be proven for custom hosts here. Cost: the
  scope moved to #3655. Rule candidate: a rule that depends on a third party's routing gets its own ticket and a
  staging check.
- **2026-11-07 (W4, custom domain).** Surprise: a create call that times out after Cloudflare accepted it leaves an
  orphaned hostname. Cost: a hostname we do not know about. Fix: the claim row is written first and a retry looks the
  hostname up before creating one. Rule candidate: every create call to a provider is safe to repeat.
- **2026-11-07 (W4, custom domain).** Surprise: FAILED rows kept squatting their domain, so no other school could
  claim it. Cost: found while reading the unique index. Fix: a FAILED row releases the host. Rule candidate: a unique
  index over a state column says which states hold the value.
- **2026-11-07 (W4, custom domain).** Surprise: all schools share one Cloudflare token, so one busy school can
  throttle the others. Cost: none yet. Fix: none yet; keep the number of Cloudflare calls per school low. Rule candidate: a shared provider token is
  a shared quota; say so in the doc.
- **2026-11-07 (W4, SEO).** Surprise: the share card draws text with system fonts, and the Alpine image had none for
  Bangla. Cost: boxes instead of letters. Fix: the Dockerfile installs Bengali and Latin fonts. Also: the sitemap lists
  only 12 blog posts until the feed is paged. The Lighthouse preview URL is noindex by design, so indexability is
  asserted in a separate check. Lighthouse numbers: not measured locally; CI-only.
- **2026-11-07 (W4 close).** Surprise: lint-staged's ESLint run is gentler than CI's `cd ui && npx eslint .`. Cost: a
  rule error shows only in CI. Rule candidate: after touching `ui/`, run the full CI-style ESLint once.
- **2026-11-07 (W4 close).** Surprise: the gate's `--only integration,infra,e2e` never runs unit specs, so a red unit
  spec can pass the gate. Cost: a failing `*.spec.ts` shows only in CI's unit job. Rule candidate: run the touched unit
  specs by hand before the gate.
- **2026-11-07 (W4 close, #3648).** `e2e/website-themes.spec.ts` publishes in a school of its own, because
  `journeys/website-setup.spec.ts` needs the shared school to be never-published. It checks the public read API
  (`/public/site/by-host/<host>/manifest`), not `html[data-theme]`, since the e2e stack has no site container; pixel
  and theme render checks are in `site/e2e/themes/*.spec.ts`. The ticket text said "six themes"; the enum has seven.
- **2026-11-07 (W5, 40.5.01).** The public results table is not a new read model: it reads the same `results`,
  `result_subjects` and `students` rows as the staff panel, behind one gate (`exams.status = 'PUBLISHED'` AND
  `website_published_at` set, same school). Withdrawing an exam, or reopening it, hides it on the next request
  because the results feed is never cached (a page of student data must not outlive a withdrawal). A Turnstile
  token works once, so only the table call carries it; the per-subject call takes the unguessable result id from a
  table answer and is throttled the same.
- **2026-11-07 (W5 review fixes, 40.5.01).** Three limits guard the results table: Turnstile and 30/min per IP
  (Nest throttler) and 300/min per school (Redis counter). When Redis is down the per-IP and per-school limits are
  OFF (D42: fail open); Turnstile still stands. The per-subject call has no Turnstile (a token works once), so what
  protects it is a signed handle: `website-results.handle.ts` signs exam id, result id and a 30-minute expiry (HMAC,
  key `JWT_SECRET`, domain `site-result:`), and `detail` accepts nothing else, so a result id can never be guessed.
  The whole results surface (list and both POSTs) answers the one 404 unless the school's Results page is switched
  on (D12). Reopening an exam takes it off the website (clears `website_published_at`, bumps the site version).
  The results page carries `noindex`; it is not in the sitemap.
