# 25. Cloudflare configuration checklist

Cloudflare sits in front of the VM and, in tunnel mode, is the only way in
(Epic 75 D1, Epic 79 D8/D14/D17). The code assumes certain dashboard settings.
If one is wrong, users get blocked, caches leak private data, or an ops tool
is open to the internet. This page lists every setting, why it matters and how
to check it.

> The commands for day 0 and deploys live in
> [28-platform-runbook.md](28-platform-runbook.md). This page keeps the dashboard settings.

## Request path

In tunnel mode no public web port exists on the VM. `cloudflared` (a container
in the edge project) dials **out** to Cloudflare and keeps the tunnel open.
Requests come back down that tunnel.

```mermaid

  V["Visitor"] --> CF["Cloudflare edge<br/>TLS, WAF, rate rule, cache bypass /api/,<br/>Access login for staging and ops,<br/>adds CF-Connecting-IP"]
  CF -->|"tunnel (outbound from the VM)"| CD["cloudflared<br/>checks the Access token on<br/>staging / kuma / beszel / logs"]
  CD -->|"plain HTTP :80 on biddaloy-edge"| N["nginx<br/>CF-Connecting-IP trusted only from EDGE_TRUSTED_CIDR,<br/>444 for unknown Host"]
  N --> A["Nest app<br/>no-store on /api/*, HSTS, STRICT throttler"]
  X["Direct hit on the VM's IP"] -. "SSH is the only open port" .-> VM["ufw: 80/443 closed"]
```

Three rules hold the whole thing together:

- DNS for every public name is a **proxied CNAME to the tunnel**
  (`<CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_ID>.cfargotunnel.com`). Leave no A record pointing at the VM.
- The tunnel config is in git (`infra/ansible/templates/cloudflared-config.yml.j2`,
  rendered to `/opt/biddaloy/edge/cloudflared/config.yml` on every edge deploy); the
  credentials JSON is in `edge.enc.env` (D17). Nothing is managed in the dashboard's
  "remotely managed" mode.
- `EDGE_TRUSTED_CIDR` must equal the subnet of the `biddaloy-edge` Docker network
  (`172.30.0.0/24`). nginx takes the visitor IP from `CF-Connecting-IP` only for
  peers in it, which in practice is `cloudflared` alone.

## Wildcard subdomain Cloudflare SaaS

School websites (Epic 40) live on `<school>.schoolmanagerp.com` and, later, on a school's own
domain. Both lanes will reach one **separate nginx listener** that serves school sites only.
Lane 1 (`<school>.schoolmanagerp.com`) is routed since #3620: cloudflared's last rule is
`http://nginx:8081`. Lane 2 (a school's own domain) is routed since #3655: the same listener lets any other well-formed host through its `$site_host_ok` gate, and the site container answers `404` unless that host is an ACTIVE custom domain. Owner steps: [28-platform-runbook, part 17](28-platform-runbook.md#part-17-school-websites).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser
  participant CF as Cloudflare
  participant T as cloudflared (tunnel)
  participant N as nginx site listener (:8081)
  participant S as site container
  Note over B,S: Lane 1. rumsc.schoolmanagerp.com (route in #3620)
  B->>CF: HTTPS, wildcard cert (one label only)
  CF->>T: proxied CNAME * to the tunnel, Host rumsc.schoolmanagerp.com
  T->>N: no fixed host matched, last rule (catch-all)
  N->>S: site server{} (unknown name gets 444)
  Note over B,S: Lane 2. www.rumsc.edu (lands in #3646 / #3655)
  B->>CF: HTTPS, Cloudflare for SaaS certificate
  CF->>T: via fallback origin sites.schoolmanagerp.com, Host stays www.rumsc.edu
  T->>N: same catch-all (it matches any Host)
  N->>S: gate lets it through; matched by custom_domain, else 404
```

- **No `*.<root>` ingress rule, on purpose.** (Staging school sites get one **exact** rule each, with Access, see row 24 and runbook 17f; cloudflared only understands a leading `*.`, so `*-staging.<root>` would never match.) cloudflared matches hostnames case-sensitively. With a
  `*.schoolmanagerp.com` rule, `STAGING.schoolmanagerp.com` would miss the staging rule, fall into
  the wildcard and skip the in-VM Access check. (A trailing-dot name matches no hostname rule at all
  and falls to the last rule.) So `cloudflared-config.yml.j2`
  has none. The school route that #3620 / #3655 add is the **last, host-agnostic rule**, and it points
  at a separate nginx listener (for example `http://nginx:8081`). That listener holds only the site
  `server{}` and a default `444`, never a fixed host. A name in capitals then lands on the site
  listener, never on staging.
- **Lane 1** needs the `*` CNAME (owner step, part 17a) and that catch-all. Free Universal certificate:
  one label only, so `<sub>.staging.schoolmanagerp.com` is not supported (D5).
- **Lane 2** uses Cloudflare for SaaS with `sites.schoolmanagerp.com` as the fallback origin. The school
  adds a CNAME at its own DNS host. cloudflared then sees the **school's** name as `Host`
  (`www.rumsc.edu`), not `sites.`, so only a host-agnostic catch-all can route it, never a
  `*.schoolmanagerp.com` rule. Server side #3646 (40.4.08), edge path #3655 (40.5.07); owner steps in runbook 17e (D23, D35).
- nginx still answers `444` for every fixed host, for anything else under the root, and for IP or malformed names (Rule 12). The custom path is a map, never a bare `server_name _`.
- **Owner check, now and after every edge change** (runbook 17a, "the case check"):
  `cloudflared tunnel --config … ingress rule https://STAGING.schoolmanagerp.com` on the VM must
  not print `service: http://nginx:80`. That is the real test: the leak sits in cloudflared's rule
  match. `curl -sI -H 'Host: STAGING.schoolmanagerp.com' https://staging.schoolmanagerp.com/` must
  also answer `302` to `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`, but that only checks the edge Access app.

Second (upper case): `302` Access, or `502`; never a `200` page. Third (not on `STAGING_SITE_HOSTS`): never a `200` page (Access `302` at the edge, or `502` / connection error). Fourth: `200` or `404`, not `302` (demo stays public). The first `302` appears whether or not the cloudflared rule works (the edge Access app answers it), so it proves nothing about the in-VM layer: runbook 17f step 3 must pass first (`ingress rule` prints a rule naming the host, and `grep` of the rendered `/opt/biddaloy/edge/cloudflared/config.yml` shows `access:` with `required: true` and the audience tag under that host). |

Paste the real output next to each command in the PR that applies the
checklist. Do not paste it here: this page holds the method, the PR holds
the evidence.

Also confirm nothing broke for: the public invoice page (`/i/:token`), the

## Access policies

Cloudflare Access puts a login in front of a hostname **at the edge**. In
tunnel mode `cloudflared` enforces it: each protected hostname in `config.yml`
has `originRequest.access.required: true` with the team name and an audience
tag, so a request without a valid Access token for that application is
rejected **before it reaches nginx**. That is a real check of the token, not a
header tripwire (D14, D17). It fails closed: if the Access application does not
exist, no token is ever issued and the host stays unreachable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U[visitor] --> CF["Cloudflare edge<br/>Access: email = owner?"]
  CF -->|no| L[login page, 302]
  CF -->|"yes, token for this application"| CD["cloudflared<br/>validates team + audience tag"] --> N[nginx] --> A[staging app / ops UIs]
```

Two audience tags, two Access applications (they go in `edge.enc.env`):

| Application | Hostnames                                     | `edge.enc.env` key      | Policy                           | Check            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `Staging`   | `STAGING_DOMAIN`, `INBOX_STAGING_DOMAIN`, and one host per staging school from `STAGING_SITE_HOSTS` (row 24) | `CF_ACCESS_AUD_STAGING` | `Owner only`, 24 h, One-time PIN | V13, V14 |
| `Ops`       | `KUMA_DOMAIN`, `BESZEL_DOMAIN`, `LOGS_DOMAIN` | `CF_ACCESS_AUD_OPS`     | `Owner only`, same               | V13 on each host |

The team name is `CF_ACCESS_TEAM` (the part before `.cloudflareaccess.com`).

**Order matters: Access application first, then the DNS record.** Kuma and
Beszel give admin to the first visitor of their setup page.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A1["1. Access application<br/>(hostname, Owner only)"] --> A2["2. copy its audience tag into edge.enc.env"] --> A3["3. biddaloy-deploy edge sha"] --> A4["4. DNS record, proxied"] --> A5["5. verify: 302 to login"]
```

### Staging (`staging.<domain>`)

1. Zero Trust > Access > Applications > **Add an application** > **Self-hosted**.
2. Name `Staging`. Session duration **24 hours**. Add public hostnames `staging.<domain>` and `inbox-staging.<domain>` (Mailpit test inbox; path empty).
3. Add policy: name `Owner only`, action **Allow**, include **Emails** = the owner's email. No other rule.
4. Identity provider: **One-time PIN** is enough. Save. Copy the application's **Audience (AUD) tag**.
5. `sops infra/secrets/edge.enc.env`: set `CF_ACCESS_TEAM` and `CF_ACCESS_AUD_STAGING` (and `INBOX_DEMO_DOMAIN`, `INBOX_STAGING_DOMAIN`). Commit, push to `main`, and `biddaloy-deploy edge <sha>`.
6. Cloudflare DNS: add the `staging`, `inbox-demo` and `inbox-staging` CNAMEs to the tunnel, **Proxied**. The owner must add both `INBOX_*` keys to `edge.enc.env` before the first edge deploy, or preflight fails.
7. Verify (V13): no cookie gives `302` to `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`; in a private window the same URL asks for a login. After login, the response carries `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`.

### Ops hosts (`kuma.`, `beszel.`, `logs.`)

Same steps with name `Ops`, the three hostnames added to one application, and
`CF_ACCESS_AUD_OPS`. These tools also have their own login (the inner layer):
Kuma and Beszel an admin account, Dozzle the users in `DOZZLE_USERS_YML`.

**The Kuma push exception (D14).** The VM's backup container and timers post job
results to `https://<KUMA_DOMAIN>/api/push/<token>` and cannot answer a login. The
tunnel config lists that one path **above** the Access rule:

```yaml
- hostname: kuma.example.com
  path: ^/api/push/
  service: http://nginx:80
```

No service token and no Access headers are needed. Kuma checks the token in the
URL itself, so treat a push URL as a secret. Setup order for the tools:
[12-operations.md §1](12-operations.md#setting-the-tools-up-by-hand-once).

## Direct mode: what replaces Cloudflare

Direct mode (`EDGE_MODE=direct`) is for a host where Cloudflare is not in front
(a BDIX data centre, later). Ports 80 and 443 are open and nginx terminates TLS.
Everything this page lists for Cloudflare either moves into the stack or is lost.

What stays with Cloudflare even then: **Turnstile** (the captcha is a Cloudflare
service that does not need Cloudflare DNS) and **R2** (backups). Test it before
you need it: the switch procedure and the first-certificate check are in
[07-deployment.md](07-deployment.md#the-two-edge-modes), and step 8 of the W3
owner list in [30-deployment-target.md](30-deployment-target.md) records that it
has not yet run on a real host.

## Re-check

Quarterly, and after any Cloudflare plan change. Rows 8, 9, 10 and 12 are
the ones that drift. Also re-read the Cloudflare for SaaS plan: the free hostname count (row 21, 100 at the time of writing) and the token scope (row 22).

## Rollback (lockout)

If users or devices get blocked, flip the item back in the dashboard first.
It takes effect in seconds.

If the tunnel itself is the problem, the edge deploy is the rollback:
`biddaloy-deploy edge <previous sha>` rewrites `config.yml` and the credentials
and restarts `cloudflared`. If a staging or ops host is locked out by a wrong
audience tag, fix `CF_ACCESS_AUD_STAGING` / `CF_ACCESS_AUD_OPS` in `edge.enc.env`
and deploy the edge again. Never open an ops host by removing `access.required`:
Kuma and Beszel make the first visitor an admin.
