# 25. Cloudflare configuration checklist

Cloudflare sits in front of the VM and, in tunnel mode, is the only way in
(Epic 75 D1, Epic 79 D8/D14/D17). The code assumes certain dashboard settings.
If one is wrong, users get blocked, caches leak private data, or an ops tool
is open to the internet. This page lists every setting, why it matters and how
to check it.

> The commands for day 0 and deploys live in
> [28-platform-runbook.md](28-platform-runbook.md). This page keeps the dashboard settings.

## Request path

In tunnel mode no public web port exists on the VM. `cloudflared` (a container
in the edge project) dials **out** to Cloudflare and keeps the tunnel open.
Requests come back down that tunnel.

  V["Visitor"] --> CF["Cloudflare edge<br/>TLS, WAF, rate rule, cache bypass /api/,<br/>Access login for staging and ops,<br/>adds CF-Connecting-IP"]
  CF -->|"tunnel (outbound from the VM)"| CD["cloudflared<br/>checks the Access token on<br/>staging / kuma / beszel / logs"]
  CD -->|"plain HTTP :80 on biddaloy-edge"| N["nginx<br/>CF-Connecting-IP trusted only from EDGE_TRUSTED_CIDR,<br/>444 for unknown Host"]
  N --> A["Nest app<br/>no-store on /api/*, HSTS, STRICT throttler"]
  X["Direct hit on the VM's IP"] -. "SSH is the only open port" .-> VM["ufw: 80/443 closed"]
```

Three rules hold the whole thing together:

- DNS for every public name is a **proxied CNAME to the tunnel**
  (`<CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_ID>.cfargotunnel.com`). Leave no A record pointing at the VM.
- The tunnel config is in git (`infra/ansible/templates/cloudflared-config.yml.j2`,
  rendered to `/opt/biddaloy/edge/cloudflared/config.yml` on every edge deploy); the
  credentials JSON is in `edge.enc.env` (D17). Nothing is managed in the dashboard's
  "remotely managed" mode.
- `EDGE_TRUSTED_CIDR` must equal the subnet of the `biddaloy-edge` Docker network
  (`172.30.0.0/24`). nginx takes the visitor IP from `CF-Connecting-IP` only for
  peers in it, which in practice is `cloudflared` alone.

## Checklist

"Applied" is filled by the owner, who has dashboard access. Every cell
starts as `pending (owner)`. Write who, when, and a link or pasted output
from the verify step.

## Access policies

Cloudflare Access puts a login in front of a hostname **at the edge**. In
tunnel mode `cloudflared` enforces it: each protected hostname in `config.yml`
has `originRequest.access.required: true` with the team name and an audience
tag, so a request without a valid Access token for that application is
rejected **before it reaches nginx**. That is a real check of the token, not a
header tripwire (D14, D17). It fails closed: if the Access application does not
exist, no token is ever issued and the host stays unreachable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U[visitor] --> CF["Cloudflare edge<br/>Access: email = owner?"]
  CF -->|no| L[login page, 302]
  CF -->|"yes, token for this application"| CD["cloudflared<br/>validates team + audience tag"] --> N[nginx] --> A[staging app / ops UIs]
```

Two audience tags, two Access applications (they go in `edge.enc.env`):

| Application | Hostnames                                     | `edge.enc.env` key      | Policy                           | Check            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `Staging`   | `STAGING_DOMAIN`                              | `CF_ACCESS_AUD_STAGING` | `Owner only`, 24 h, One-time PIN | V13              |
| `Ops`       | `KUMA_DOMAIN`, `BESZEL_DOMAIN`, `LOGS_DOMAIN` | `CF_ACCESS_AUD_OPS`     | `Owner only`, same               | V13 on each host |

The team name is `CF_ACCESS_TEAM` (the part before `.cloudflareaccess.com`).

**Order matters: Access application first, then the DNS record.** Kuma and
Beszel give admin to the first visitor of their setup page.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A1["1. Access application<br/>(hostname, Owner only)"] --> A2["2. copy its audience tag into edge.enc.env"] --> A3["3. biddaloy-deploy edge sha"] --> A4["4. DNS record, proxied"] --> A5["5. verify: 302 to login"]
```

### Staging (`staging.<domain>`)

1. Zero Trust > Access > Applications > **Add an application** > **Self-hosted**.
2. Name `Staging`. Session duration **24 hours**. Add public hostnames `staging.<domain>` and `inbox-staging.<domain>` (Mailpit test inbox; path empty).
3. Add policy: name `Owner only`, action **Allow**, include **Emails** = the owner's email. No other rule.
4. Identity provider: **One-time PIN** is enough. Save. Copy the application's **Audience (AUD) tag**.
5. `sops infra/secrets/edge.enc.env`: set `CF_ACCESS_TEAM` and `CF_ACCESS_AUD_STAGING` (and `INBOX_DEMO_DOMAIN`, `INBOX_STAGING_DOMAIN`). Commit, push to `main`, and `biddaloy-deploy edge <sha>`.
6. Cloudflare DNS: add the `staging` CNAME to the tunnel, **Proxied**.
7. Verify (V13): no cookie gives `302` to `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`; in a private window the same URL asks for a login. After login, the response carries `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`.

### Ops hosts (`kuma.`, `beszel.`, `logs.`)

Same steps with name `Ops`, the three hostnames added to one application, and
`CF_ACCESS_AUD_OPS`. These tools also have their own login (the inner layer):
Kuma and Beszel an admin account, Dozzle the users in `DOZZLE_USERS_YML`.

**The Kuma push exception (D14).** The VM's backup container and timers post job
results to `https://<KUMA_DOMAIN>/api/push/<token>` and cannot answer a login. The
tunnel config lists that one path **above** the Access rule:

```yaml
- hostname: kuma.example.com
  path: ^/api/push/
  service: http://nginx:80
```

No service token and no Access headers are needed. Kuma checks the token in the
URL itself, so treat a push URL as a secret. Setup order for the tools:
[12-operations.md §1](12-operations.md#setting-the-tools-up-by-hand-once).

## Direct mode: what replaces Cloudflare

Direct mode (`EDGE_MODE=direct`) is for a host where Cloudflare is not in front
(a BDIX data centre, later). Ports 80 and 443 are open and nginx terminates TLS.
Everything this page lists for Cloudflare either moves into the stack or is lost.

What stays with Cloudflare even then: **Turnstile** (the captcha is a Cloudflare
service that does not need Cloudflare DNS) and **R2** (backups). Test it before
you need it: the switch procedure and the first-certificate check are in
[07-deployment.md](07-deployment.md#the-two-edge-modes), and step 8 of the W3
owner list in [30-deployment-target.md](30-deployment-target.md) records that it
has not yet run on a real host.

## Re-check

Quarterly, and after any Cloudflare plan change. Rows 8, 9, 10 and 12 are
the ones that drift.

## Rollback (lockout)

If users or devices get blocked, flip the item back in the dashboard first.
It takes effect in seconds.

If the tunnel itself is the problem, the edge deploy is the rollback:
`biddaloy-deploy edge <previous sha>` rewrites `config.yml` and the credentials
and restarts `cloudflared`. If a staging or ops host is locked out by a wrong
audience tag, fix `CF_ACCESS_AUD_STAGING` / `CF_ACCESS_AUD_OPS` in `edge.enc.env`
and deploy the edge again. Never open an ops host by removing `access.required`:
Kuma and Beszel make the first visitor an admin.
