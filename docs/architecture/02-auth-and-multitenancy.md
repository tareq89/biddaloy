## The core idea: tenants, not a single school

SchoolManager hosts **many independent schools** on one deployment. A `School`
row _is_ a tenant. Everything school-specific — students, classes, fees,
staff — is scoped to exactly one tenant. A single `User` account, however,
is **not** tenant-scoped: the same person can belong to multiple schools,
with a different role at each.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ UserTenant : "membership"
    School ||--o{ UserTenant : "membership"
    UserTenant {
        uuid user_id
        uuid tenant_id
        enum role "SUPER_ADMIN | ADMIN | ACCOUNTANT | TEACHER | PARENT | STUDENT | EXECUTIVE | OFFICE_STAFF | EXAM_CONTROLLER | COMMITTEE"
    }
```

Example: Fatima is a `TEACHER` at Greenview School and a `PARENT` at
Riverside School (her own child studies there) — one `User` row, two
`UserTenant` rows.

## Same person in several schools

One person has **one login**: one email, one phone, one password, and any
Google or Facebook sign-ins. That login is shared by every school the person
belongs to. Each school then has its own membership row and its own profile
row for that person.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users ||--o{ user_identities : "Google or Facebook sign-ins"
    users ||--o{ user_tenants : "one row per school and role"
    schools ||--o{ user_tenants : "members"
    users ||--o{ teachers : "profile, one per school"
    users ||--o{ guardians : "profile, one per school"
    users ||--o{ staff_profiles : "profile, one per school"
    users ||--o{ students : "profile, one per school"
    users {
        uuid id
        string email "unique across the platform"
        string phone "unique across the platform"
        string password_hash
    }
    user_identities {
        uuid user_id
        string provider "google or facebook"
    }
    user_tenants {
        uuid user_id
        uuid tenant_id
        enum role
        timestamp deleted_at "set when the person leaves or is removed"
    }
    teachers {
        uuid user_id
        uuid tenant_id
    }
    guardians {
        uuid user_id
        uuid tenant_id
    }
```

The entities are `server/src/modules/users/entities/user.entity.ts`
(`users`), `server/src/modules/auth/entities/user-tenant.entity.ts`
(`user_tenants`) and `server/src/modules/auth/entities/user-identity.entity.ts`
(`user_identities`). The profile tables (`teachers`, `guardians`,
`staff_profiles`, `students`) each carry a `tenant_id`.

**One profile per school (Epic 58.0 W0).** Each profile table links to `users`
with `@ManyToOne`, and is unique on `(tenant_id, user_id)` for live rows
(`teachers.employee_id` is unique per school too). `users.email` stays global.

Example: Rahim teaches ICT in High School and in the College branch. He has one
login, two `user_tenants` rows and two `teachers` rows, each with its own
employee id, attendance, leave and ACR (D14).

Three more rules from Epic 58.0:

- **D12, clash scope.** The routine double-booking check also scans other
  schools where the acting user is a member. It never reads a school the actor
  cannot see.
- **D13, guardian switcher.** A guardian with children in two schools uses the
  existing school switcher. There is no merged cross-school view yet.
- **D41, joining is never silent.** School B files a join request, the person
  accepts, and only then does B appear in their switcher. See
  `e2e/journeys/multi-branch-teacher.spec.ts`.

Because the login is shared, no single school owns it. These rules come from
decisions D12 and D16 of Epic 68 (#2150):

| Action on the shared login                              | Who may do it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Enforced by                                                                                                                                                    |

A join request is an `auth_tokens` row with purpose `JOIN_SCHOOL` in the
inviting school. No `user_tenants` row exists until the person says yes, so
no guard, list or message can see them early.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Admin as School B admin
    participant S as Server
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    actor P as The person

    Admin->>S: adds an existing account, e.g. guardian invite batch
    S->>DB: INSERT auth_tokens, purpose JOIN_SCHOOL, metadata.role
    Note over DB: no user_tenants row yet
    P->>S: GET /account/school-invites
    S-->>P: School B, role PARENT, expires_at
    Note over P: account menu and an alert card show Accept and Decline
    P->>S: POST /account/school-invites/:id/accept
    S->>DB: lock the request, INSERT user_tenants, consume the token, audit
    S-->>P: 204
    P->>S: POST /auth/refresh
    S-->>P: new access token whose memberships include School B
    P->>P: switches to School B
```

Decline is `POST /account/school-invites/:id/decline`; it revokes the request
and creates nothing. These three routes need a signed-in user but no
`X-Tenant-ID`: the person is not a member of School B yet, and every id is
matched to the caller's own user id. The UI is
`client-admin/src/components/staff-user-menu.tsx` and
`ui/src/components/school-invites-card.tsx`.

**Worked example.** Fatima is a `TEACHER` at Greenview and a `PARENT` at
Riverside. Riverside's admin tries to fix her phone number:

```http
PATCH /api/v1/users/<fatima's user id>
X-Tenant-ID: <riverside id>

{ "phone": "+8801811111111" }
```

```json
{
  "statusCode": 409,
  "message": "This person also belongs to another school. Only they can change their email or phone, from their own profile.",
  "details": { "code": "SHARED_IDENTITY" }
}
```

Nothing changes. If Riverside could change it, Riverside could then reset
the password and sign in as Fatima at Greenview. Instead Fatima opens her
own profile and sends `POST /api/v1/users/me/contact-change` with
`{ "phone": "+8801811111111", "current_password": "…" }`. A code goes to the
new number. She enters it (`POST /api/v1/users/me/contact-change/confirm-phone`),
and only then does the phone change, for both schools at once.

The full list of rules like these, per domain, is
[36-domain-invariants.md](36-domain-invariants.md).

## Client session lifecycle

`client-admin` keeps the access token in memory only (never
`localStorage`/`sessionStorage` — see [06-frontend-architecture.md](06-frontend-architecture.md)),
so a hard page reload always starts with nothing to send, even when the
httpOnly refresh cookie above is still valid. [8.9.3] is what makes that
transparent: every route is gated behind a check that silently tries the
refresh cookie once per page load before deciding whether the visitor is
actually logged out.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Visitor
    participant R as Router (beforeLoad)
    participant C as Client session (ui/src/api/session.ts)
    participant S as NestJS server

    U->>R: navigates to a protected route
    R->>C: ensureSessionLoaded()
    alt access token already set
        C-->>R: true (no network call)
    else cold load
        C->>S: POST /auth/refresh (httpOnly cookie)
        alt cookie still valid
            S-->>C: new access token
            C->>C: arm a refresh timer ~60s before it expires
            C-->>R: true
        else cookie missing/expired
            S-->>C: 401
            C-->>R: false (routine — not an error, nothing to notify)
        end
    end
    R-->>U: renders the route, or redirects to /login?redirect=<original path>
```

A refresh failing _after_ a session was already established (the
proactive timer above firing too late, or a request hitting a genuinely
dead token) is a different, louder event — that path already existed
before [8.9.3] (`client.ts`'s reactive 401 handling) and calls
`notifySessionExpired()`, which `client-admin/src/main.tsx` turns into the
same `/login` redirect. See [`ui/README.md`'s "Auth" section](../../ui/README.md)
for the full function-level write-up (`ensureSessionLoaded`,
`scheduleTokenRefresh`, `logout`/`logoutAll`).

## The tenant header contract

Every tenant-scoped controller is decorated with `@ApiTenantAuth()`
(`server/src/common/decorators/api-tenant-auth.decorator.ts`), which
documents and enforces:

- **`Authorization: Bearer <token>`** — required, always.
- **`X-Tenant-ID: <school id>`** — required. `ContextGuard` validates this
  against the caller's own `UserTenant` memberships; a tenant ID the caller
  doesn't belong to is rejected, not silently ignored.
- **`X-Role: <role>`** — optional. Only needed when a caller has more than
  one role _within that same tenant_; otherwise the first matching
  membership is used.

This means authorization is always **"is this user a member of this
specific tenant, and if so with what role"** — never a global role check.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Roles are fixed and defined once in `shared/src/enums/index.ts`
(`UserRole`), shared by server and every client so they can never drift:

```
SUPER_ADMIN → ADMIN → ACCOUNTANT → EXECUTIVE → TEACHER → EXAM_CONTROLLER → OFFICE_STAFF → COMMITTEE → PARENT / STUDENT
```

(highest to lowest priority — see `ROLE_PRIORITY` in `context.guard.ts`,
used as a tiebreak when a caller has multiple roles in one tenant and omits
`X-Role`). Routes declare required roles with the `@Roles(...)` decorator;
`RolesGuard` enforces it after `ContextGuard` has resolved which role the
caller is acting as.

| Role              | Who it is for                           | Data scope (`ROLE_SCOPE`) |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |

`SUPER_ADMIN`'s `TENANT` scope does not open a school's own data (marks,
attendance, homework, performance): `hasTenantDataScope` in
`shared/src/enums/audiences.ts` holds it out until product decides (#1362
D-N). Tenant scope is always paired with the route's permission.

These are code roles, not runtime-editable ones: each role is wired into
guards, menus and data scope at build time, so a school cannot invent one
(decision D1 of [Epic #786](https://github.com/tareq89/biddaloy/issues/786)).
Demo accounts for every role live in `ROLE_TEST_USERS`
(`server/src/scripts/seed.util.ts`), e.g. `office@biddaloy.test`.

This was a deliberate choice over attribute-based access control (ABAC):
school roles map cleanly onto real staff titles, and finer-grained rules
(e.g. "a class teacher can only see their own section") can be layered on
top of roles later if needed, without redesigning the model now.

### Roles and permissions, both

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  REQ[HTTP request] --> JWT["AuthGuard('jwt')\n(who are you)"]
  JWT --> CTX["ContextGuard\n(which tenant + role)"]
  CTX --> ROLES["RolesGuard\n@Roles(...)\nrole allow-list"]
  ROLES --> PERMS["PermissionsGuard\n@RequirePermissions(...)\nROLE_PERMISSIONS[role] ⊇ required?"]
  PERMS --> HANDLER[controller method]
```

**Security rules** for this path live in [08-security.md](08-security.md#security-rules):
[Rule 1](08-security.md#rule-1-routes-are-closed-by-default) (routes closed by default),
[Rule 2](08-security.md#rule-2-teacher-reads-are-scoped-to-assigned-sections) (teacher scope; a coordinator row widens reads only, through `includeCoordinated` — see [03-backend-modules.md](03-backend-modules.md#coordinators-widen-reads-never-writes-epic-83)),
[Rule 8](08-security.md#rule-8-suspend-remove-or-reset-bumps-tokens_valid_after) (session cut-off) and
[Rule 15](08-security.md#rule-15-redis-down-has-a-written-answer-per-route) (Redis down).

`@Roles` says which roles may reach a route; `@RequirePermissions` says
which capability from `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` (`shared/src/enums/permissions.ts`)
the route exercises. Both run today.

On a tenant route with `@RequirePermissions`, the permission is the real
gate. `@Roles` now exists only on routes listed in `ROLE_NARROWINGS` or
`IDENTITY_SCOPED` (`permission-matrix.e2e-spec.ts`). Everywhere else it was
redundant and was deleted (Epic 24.0).

`PermissionsGuard` **fails closed**: every route behind it carries either
`@RequirePermissions` or `@AuthenticatedOnly()`. A route with neither is a 403
(`This route declares no permission`).

`IDENTITY_SCOPED` routes are the exception: some carry no
`@RequirePermissions` at all and are marked `@AuthenticatedOnly()` instead
(`permission-matrix.e2e-spec.ts` proves the marker and the list match
one-for-one). The gate is the route's own identity check, plus its `@Roles`
list where it has one. Seven identity routes have no `@Roles` at all (the five
`/attention/*` routes, `GET /schools/:id/logo`, `GET /schools/me/profile`): there
the service's identity check is the only gate. Example: `GET /leave/balance` acts
only on the caller's own staff profile.

`ContextGuard` trusts the memberships inside the JWT. What makes a removed membership disappear within one request is the session cut-off (`users.tokens_valid_after`, checked in `JwtStrategy`; see [08-security](08-security.md) "Session cut-off").

Which status a refused request gets depends on which guard refuses it:

| Request                                                                                         | Refused by         | Status                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Valid token, wrong role, route has **no** `@Roles` (most routes)                                | `PermissionsGuard` | **403** `Requires permission(s): …`                     |
| Valid token, wrong role, route **still has** `@Roles` (a narrowing or identity-scoped route)    | `RolesGuard`       | **403** `Requires one of roles: …` (since #1360 / #729) |
| Route behind `PermissionsGuard` declares no `@RequirePermissions` and no `@AuthenticatedOnly()` | `PermissionsGuard` | **403** `This route declares no permission`             |
| `X-Role` names a role the user does not hold in this tenant                                     | `ContextGuard`     | **401**                                                 |
| Missing or bad token                                                                            | `AuthGuard('jwt')` | **401**                                                 |

`ContextGuard` also checks the school's own state, after the role is resolved (the platform tenant is exempt from both):

| School state                                       | Request                                               | Answer                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SUSPENDED`                                        | anything, unless `@AllowWhenSuspendedForBilling`      | **403** `TENANT_SUSPENDED` (plus `reason` for a billing suspension)      |
| `ACTIVE`, over its seats (7-day grace, Epic 49 D9) | `POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`, unless the handler is marked | **403** `TENANT_READ_ONLY` with `details.until`; `GET/HEAD/OPTIONS` pass |
| `ACTIVE`, a backup restore running                 | `POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`                               | **423** `TENANT_RESTORING`                                               |

How the grace window and the suspension work: [34-onboarding](34-onboarding.md) "Over the seats".

Example, with a PARENT token for the same school:

- `GET /guardians` (no `@Roles`; PARENT lacks `GUARDIAN_READ`) → `403`.
- `GET /homework` (keeps `@Roles(ADMIN, TEACHER)`, see below) → `403`.

Example of a narrowing: `GET /homework`. PARENT and STUDENT hold
`HOMEWORK_READ` (for their own child's view). This route is the teacher/admin
list across all students, so it keeps `@Roles(ADMIN, TEACHER)` to keep
families out.

A narrowing can retire later: give the route its own permission, grant it to
the roles in `@Roles`, delete the `@Roles` line and the `ROLE_NARROWINGS`
entry. When the list is empty, delete `RolesGuard`.

### Step-up approval (16.2) — re-entering an approver's code for a risky action

Some actions (reversing a payment, discounting a bill past a threshold,
creating a duplicate fee, voiding an invoice) need a fresh, in-the-moment
re-authentication of an admin — not just the acting user's own login. The
approver can be the person acting. `@RequireApproval` marks a route as
gated; walking the modal through to a token is the same flow everywhere,
regardless of which route triggered it.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Staff as Acting user
    participant UI as AdminVerificationModal
    participant API as POST /auth/step-up*
    participant Guard as ApprovalGuard
    participant Route as Gated route<br/>(e.g. POST /payments/:id/reverse)
    actor Audit as audit_logs

    Staff->>Route: original request, no token
    Route->>Guard: @RequireApproval(scope)
    Guard-->>Staff: 403 { details: { code: "APPROVAL_REQUIRED", scope } }
    Staff->>UI: modal opens (useApprovedMutation)
    UI->>API: POST /auth/step-up/otp/request { identifier, scope }
    API-->>UI: 202 (always — never reveals if identifier is an approver)
    Staff->>UI: enters the approver's OTP (or password)
    UI->>API: POST /auth/step-up { identifier, method, otp, scope }
    API->>Audit: record step-up attempt (success or failure)
    API-->>UI: { approval_token, expires_at, approver }
    UI->>Route: retries original request,<br/>header X-Approval-Token: <approval_token>
    Route->>Guard: verify token — scope, actor, tenant, single-use
    Guard->>Audit: record token consumption
    Guard-->>Staff: request proceeds
```

What the server checks when the acting user types an approver identifier:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Acting user types an approver identifier"] --> B{"Active member of this school<br/>who holds FEE_APPROVE?"}
    B -- no --> X["Uniform 401, audited"]
    B -- yes --> C["Check their OTP or password"]
    C --> D["Token: sub = approver, act = acting user"]
    D --> E["Both ids written to the audit row"]
```

Example: in a school with one admin, Rahim is the admin. Rahim reverses a
payment and types his own code as the approver. That is allowed. The audit row
shows `approver_id = actor_id = Rahim`.

A few things worth being explicit about, because they're easy to get wrong
building a new gated route:

- **The approver can be the acting user, but a reversal checks who else
  could have approved.** Step-up itself lets the actor verify as their own
  approver (pinned by `step-up.controller.e2e-spec.ts`, "the actor may verify
  themselves as the approver"). `POST /payments/:id/reverse` then applies the
  Epic 78 D1 rule in `PaymentReversalService` before any lock or money row:

  ```mermaid
  flowchart TD
    A[approver == actor?] -- no --> OK[reversal runs<br/>audit self_approved: false]
    A -- yes --> B{fees.requireSecondApprover on?}
    B -- yes --> NO[403 SECOND_APPROVER_REQUIRED<br/>nothing changes]
    B -- no --> C{another ACTIVE FEE_APPROVE holder<br/>in this school? SUPER_ADMIN does not count}
    C -- yes --> NO
    C -- no --> OK2[reversal runs<br/>audit self_approved: true]
  ```

  Example: Rahim is the only admin of his school and reverses a payment with
  his own code. That runs, and the audit row says `self_approved: true`. Once
  a second admin, Karim, joins, Rahim's own code is refused with
  `403 { details: { code: "SECOND_APPROVER_REQUIRED" } }`; the approval token
  is already spent, so he runs step-up again with Karim's code. A school can
  also turn on **Always need a second admin to reverse a payment**
  (`fees.requireSecondApprover`) to refuse self-approval even with one admin.

- **Attempts are counted three ways** (Redis, 15-minute window, limit
  `STEP_UP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, default 5). Every attempt counts, right
  or wrong, before the credential is checked. Any one over its limit is a 429.
  The approver key is counted only after the caller's own two keys allow the
  attempt, so one caller adds at most 5 to it.

  | Key                                                  | Limit   | Why                                                                |
  | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `step-up-attempts:pair:<tenant>:<caller>:<approver>` | 5       | One caller's attempts never lock the approver out for others.      |
  | `step-up-attempts:actor:<caller>`                    | 5       | One caller cannot spread guesses over many approvers.              |
  | `step-up-attempts:approver:<tenant>:<approver>`      | 20 (4x) | Many callers together cannot multiply the guesses at one approver. |

  Code requests have the same 20 ceiling per approver
  (`step-up-otp-requests:approver:…`): past it, the 202 still comes back but no
  new code is sent, so ten staff cannot text one approver ten times. Only codes
  actually sent count: a request inside the caller's own 60 s cooldown sends
  nothing and gives its slot back.

- **A step-up code is bound to the school, the caller and the scope it was
  requested for.** `POST /auth/step-up/otp/request` takes `{ identifier, scope }`
  and the code is stored under `tenant:caller:scope:approver`. Using it for a
  different scope or from a different account fails like a wrong code.
  Example: a code requested for `fees.discount` and sent to `POST /auth/step-up`
  with `scope: payments.reverse` gives `401 Invalid credentials`, the same body
  and the same audit row as a wrong code. The three attempt counters above
  carry no scope, so rotating the scope buys no extra guesses.
- **The 403 body is nested.** `ApprovalRequiredException`
  (`server/src/common/errors/approval-required.exception.ts`) must put
  `code`/`scope` under a `details` key — the global exception filter only
  ever forwards a top-level `details` field onto the wire, and every
  consumer (`ui/src/hooks/approval.tsx`'s `isApprovalRequiredError`,
  `ui/src/api/errors.ts`'s `ApiError.details`) reads `error.details.code`. A
  flat `{code, scope}` body silently breaks every step-up flow in the app —
  this happened once already (fixed in [16.2.5]'s wave-close pass) and every
  mocked component test kept passing throughout, because the mocks assumed
  the correct nested shape from the start. Only a live-server test (an
  `e2e/journeys/*.spec.ts` hitting the real guard, not a `msw`-mocked one)
  catches this class of drift.
- **A token is single-use and scope-bound.** `approval_token` is consumed by
  `ApprovalGuard` on first successful use; a retry with the same token — even
  against the same route — gets another `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` 403.
  `e2e/journeys/step-up.spec.ts` (16.2.5) proves the whole loop end to end:
  no token → 403, full OTP round trip → token → route succeeds once →
  same token replayed → 403 again.
- **A refused reversal still spends the code.** `ApprovalGuard` burns the
  token before the handler runs, so if the handler then answers 409 the admin
  needs a new OTP. Accepted on purpose (F-153): a token is a one-shot "yes",
  not a reservation. Example: reversing payment #1 while payment #2 exists
  answers `REVERSE_LATER_PAYMENTS_FIRST` (`payment-reversal.service.ts`; the
  route is `@RequireApproval(PAYMENTS_REVERSE)` in `checkout.controller.ts`);
  the OTP is gone, so the retry after reversing #2 asks for a fresh one. The
  same holds for `REVERSE_RETRY`. Checkout is the exception: it checks the
  wallet balance before it spends the token.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Admin->>ApprovalGuard: reverse payment #1 + OTP token
  ApprovalGuard->>ApprovalGuard: spend token (single-use)
  ApprovalGuard->>PaymentReversalService: reverse #1
  PaymentReversalService-->>Admin: 409 REVERSE_LATER_PAYMENTS_FIRST
  Note over Admin: needs a new OTP to retry
```

- **`ApprovalGuard` runs after `RolesGuard`/`PermissionsGuard`.** A caller
  who isn't allowed on the route at all still gets a plain 401/403 from the
  earlier guards, not `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` — the step-up prompt only appears
  once the caller has cleared "can you call this route," to avoid using
  "approval required" as a way to fingerprint routes a caller can't see.

## Invitations & account access

When an admin creates a user without a password (`POST /users`, no
`password` field), the account is created with `password_hash = null` and
cannot log in on its own — it needs an activation link. "Invited" is not a
stored status: it's derived from `password_hash` plus the newest
`auth_tokens` row for that user, so no `UserStatus` enum churn was needed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant UserController
    participant InvitationService
    participant AuthTokenService
    participant Delivery as AccountAccessDeliveryService
    participant SMS/Email

    Admin->>UserController: POST /users (no password)
    UserController->>InvitationService: issueAndSend(userId, tenantId)
    InvitationService->>AuthTokenService: issue(INVITE, ttl=7d)
    AuthTokenService-->>InvitationService: raw token (never logged)
    InvitationService->>Delivery: deliver(link with raw token)
    Delivery->>SMS/Email: send(real body)
    Delivery-->>InvitationService: logId, status
    InvitationService-->>UserController: { status, medium, expires_at }
```

Key points:

- **One shared `auth_tokens` table** (`AuthToken` entity) backs invitations
  today and password resets / email verification in later sub-issues
  (12.3, 12.7) — same hashed-token pattern as `refresh_tokens`: only a
  SHA-256 hash of the random secret is ever stored.

  | id      | user_id | purpose  | token_hash (64 hex) | expires_at | consumed_at                                  |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
  | `a1b2…` | `u-42`  | `INVITE` | `9f86d0…`           | in 7 days  | `null`                                       |
  | `c3d4…` | `u-42`  | `INVITE` | `e3b0c4…`           | (expired)  | `2026-08-01` (consumed, from a prior resend) |

- **Delivery never leaks the secret into the communication log.**
  `AccountAccessDeliveryService` writes a `CommunicationLog` row (so the
  send is visible in the same audit trail as any other message) but with
  `message_body` redacted (`••••••` in place of the link/code) — the real
  body is a local variable, sent straight to the provider, and never
  persisted or logged. `trigger = ACCOUNT_ACCESS` marks these rows apart
  from ordinary reminders.
- **One shared `OtpService`** (Redis, 6-digit codes, 5-minute TTL, 5
  attempts then a 15-minute lock) is shared by forgot-password, admin
  reset, OTP sign-in, contact change, registration and step-up. It lives
  in the `account-access` module.
- **Resend revokes prior links.** `POST /users/:id/invitation/resend`
  calls the same `issueAndSend` path, which revokes every still-live
  invite for that user before issuing a new one — a stale link in an old
  email can never be used once a resend happens.
- A delivery failure (bad phone number, provider outage) never rolls back
  the user that was just created — user creation and invitation dispatch
  are independent outcomes.

#### How many codes one phone or email can get (GAP-05)

Each purpose has a 60-second cooldown. On top of that, one phone or email
gets at most 5 codes **per purpose per hour** (sign-in, reset, registration
and phone check each have their own count). Step-up codes are not counted,
because they are not sent anywhere.

Why per purpose and per hour: the first version shared 10 codes a day across
all purposes. Anyone could then spend a parent's codes in ten minutes and
lock them out of both sign-in and password reset for a whole day. Now a
stranger can block one purpose for at most an hour.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Code requested] --> U{"Admin reset?"}
  U -- yes --> C
  U -- no --> B{"This purpose's count this hour >= 5?"}
  B -- yes --> X[429 Too Many Requests]
  B -- no --> C{Cooldown live?}
  C -- yes --> X
  C -- no --> D["Issue code, count + 1<br/>(first one starts the 1 h clock)"]
```

Example: `01712345678`, `+880 1712-345678` and `8801712345678` are one
handset, so sign-in codes for any of them count against the Redis key
`otp-cap:LOGIN:8801712345678`. `Foo@X.com` resetting a password counts
against `otp-cap:PASSWORD_RESET:foo@x.com`.

An admin reset (`POST /users/:id/reset-password`) skips the cap, so a
stranger cannot block it, and it asks for the code before signing the user
out, so a refused code (cooldown) signs nobody out.

Forgot-password and OTP sign-in still answer 202 when refused (so nobody
can tell which numbers have accounts). Their "enter the code" screen says
so: "No code after a few tries? Wait an hour, then try again."
Registration and contact change show the 429. Per-school and global caps
are #1759.

### Batch invites (12.6) — inviting a whole imported cohort's guardians

Bulk-imported students get Guardian rows but no login — so "invite this
cohort's guardians" is a **preview-first batch action**, not an import side
effect. It reuses 12.1's `issueAndSend` per guardian, fanned out over a
queue, with a `batch_id` (not a new `ReminderBatch`-shaped entity) tying
the fan-out back together for progress polling:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant UserController
    participant Provisioning as GuardianProvisioningService
    participant Queue as invitation-batch queue
    participant Processor as InvitationBatchProcessor
    participant InvitationService

    Admin->>UserController: POST /users/invitations/preview {all: true}
    UserController->>Provisioning: preview(tenantId, selection)
    Provisioning-->>Admin: { to_invite[], skipped[] } (read-only)

    Admin->>UserController: POST /users/invitations/batch (confirm)
    UserController->>Provisioning: dispatch(tenantId, actorUserId, selection)
    Provisioning->>Queue: add one job per to_invite guardian
    Provisioning-->>Admin: { batch_id, queued, skipped }

    loop per queued job
        Queue->>Processor: { tenantId, guardianId, batchId }
        Processor->>Processor: ensureUser (create PARENT, or a join request for an existing verified account)
        Processor->>InvitationService: issueAndSend(userId, metadata: {batch_id})
    end

    Admin->>UserController: GET /users/invitations/batch/:id (polls)
    UserController-->>Admin: { total, sent, failed, queued }
```

Key points:

- **Sibling dedup is free.** Two students sharing one guardian's phone
  already collapse to one `Guardian` row (`bulk-upload.service.ts`'s
  phone-dedup) — one guardian, one `ensureUser` call, one account.
- **`batch_id` lives in `metadata`, not a new table.** It's written into
  `auth_tokens.metadata.batch_id` (via `issueAndSend`'s `metadata`
  parameter) and `communication_logs.metadata.batch_id` (via `deliver`'s
  `metadata` parameter). `batchStatus` counts `communication_logs` rows by
  that key and reads `total` back from the batch-dispatch audit row
  (`AuditAction.INVITATION_SENT`, `entity_type: 'InvitationBatch'`) —
  the same "derive it, don't store a redundant counter" instinct
  `deriveInvitationStatus` already uses.
- **Skip reasons mirror the reminder-batch preview grammar** —
  `no_contact` / `already_active` / `already_pending` /
  `notifications_disabled` — so staff read the same shape of "who got
  skipped and why" they already know from bulk reminders.
- **`ensureUser` is idempotent under retry.** A guardian already linked to
  a `User` is loaded, not recreated; a guardian matching an existing
  `User` by a _verified_ phone or email, and not yet a member of this
  school (or holding a password but no `PARENT` role here), is not linked
  silently: that person gets a `JOIN_SCHOOL` request to accept (see
  [Same person in several schools](#same-person-in-several-schools)); a
  `23505` race between two concurrent batches is retried as "found".

- **Code sign-in works by phone or email.** The identifier is either one.
  `/otp/verify` also returns `needs_password` and `password_required`
  (no password + staff role + no linked social account). The gate is
  client-side, stored per account and cleared on logout or when a password is
  set. Server enforcement is open: #1697. See
  [34-onboarding.md](34-onboarding.md).
- **Password rules depend on the role**, checked only when a password is set
  or changed (never at sign-in). Strictest role across all memberships wins.

  | Roles                    | Rules                                       |
  | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
  | Any staff role, or mixed | 8+ characters, upper, lower, digit, special |
  | Only PARENT / STUDENT    | 8+ characters, a digit                      |

- **Google and Facebook.** The server lists the
  configured providers (`GET /auth/social/providers`) and the UI draws one
  button each. The flow is server-side authorization code with PKCE and
  `state`. Identities live in `user_identities`. **Connecting is always
  explicit** (`POST /auth/social/:provider/link-start` from a signed-in
  session, with the account's `current_password`). An identity is never attached by matching email. Example: a Google
  account with `rahim@example.com` does not sign in to a user who has that
  email unless it was connected first.
- **Leaving and former members.** Staff leave with `POST /users/me/leave`.
  An admin removes with `DELETE /users/:id`. Both soft-delete the
  `user_tenants` row (`deleted_at`); the user account and their other schools
  stay. The last admin cannot leave or be removed. Guardians and students
  have no "leave". `POST /users/:id/restore` (needs `MEMBER_REMOVE`, ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN only today) brings back the rows
  ended by the latest event. A person with no active staff role is a
  "Former" member.

## Why this deviated from the original plan

The original plan assumed one school and a single `role` column directly on
`User`. Multi-tenancy was added during build because the same account needs
to represent different people-in-context at different schools — a column on
`User` can't express "TEACHER here, PARENT there" for one person. The
`UserTenant` join table is what makes that possible, and it's the reason
almost every entity in [01-domain-model.md](01-domain-model.md) carries an
explicit tenant reference.

- **D12 (Epic 68): a shared login is owned by the person, not by a school.**
  School admins used to edit any member's email or phone (`PATCH /users/:id`)
  and reset their password. For a person in two schools, that let one school
  take over the login used at the other. Epic 68 replaced it: the person
  changes their own contact through the verify flow, an admin edit or reset
  of a shared login answers `409 SHARED_IDENTITY`, and joining a school is a
  request the person accepts. The alternative, admin edit plus a
  verification step, was considered and rejected.
