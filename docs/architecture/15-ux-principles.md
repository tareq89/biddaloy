# UX Principles — placement, navigation, keyboard, and "no silent gaps"

Decided 2026-09-17 while planning the academics epics (19.0–29.0) from the
reference-ERP analysis. This doc is the **interaction** contract; the
**visual** contract (type, colour, elevation, motion, focus vocabulary,
table→card grammar) stays in [09-design-direction.md](09-design-direction.md);
the **pattern** contract (which component, page shape, container, format and
wording a screen uses) is [21-ui-patterns.md](21-ui-patterns.md).
Read all three before planning any screen.

## 1. The rules in one screen

| #   | Rule                                            | What it means in practice                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| U1  | **Every feature has one natural place.**        | Each screen is placed in the nav tree below (§3). Sub-features nest under their parent; nothing new is a top-level item unless a user job needs it. Every epic states _where each screen lives_ against this tree.        |
| U2  | **No silent gaps.**                             | Every registry that enumerates screens, entities or actions has a guard that **fails CI** when a new thing isn't registered (§2). A new screen may be wrong; it can never be _unchecked_.                                 |
| U3  | **Keyboard and accessibility are first-class.** | Every screen is fully keyboard-operable; the axe gate stays blocking; every nav group has one keyboard-journey spec and a new screen adds a test to its group's spec; a manual screen-reader pass closes every epic (§6). |
| U4  | **One palette, `Ctrl/Cmd+K`.**                  | Three tabs — _People · Page · Action_ — switchable by keyboard. Actions come from a registry, not from ad-hoc buttons (§4).                                                                                               |
| U5  | **Breadcrumbs mirror the URL.**                 | Derived from the route tree, entity names when loaded (a skeleton bar, never an id, while loading), clickable, shown only from 2 levels, identical on every screen (§5).                                                  |
| U6  | **Nothing new is unrecoverable.**               | Any epic that adds an entity ships its workbook tab (export + restore + round-trip test) and seed coverage in its wave-close ticket (§7).                                                                                 |
| U7  | **Reuse the shell, reuse the form.**            | New screens use `ui/src/shells/*` (list / detail / form / wizard). A palette action that opens a modal renders the _same_ form component as the page — never a second copy.                                               |

## 2. No silent gaps — the registries and their guards

SchoolManager already has several lists that enumerate "everything". The
problem is that most of them are hand-maintained: adding a route to the
router without adding it to the manifest silently drops that screen out of
the a11y gate. The fix is one guard per registry.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  F["A dialog file in routes/"] --> Q{"Is it in the palette?"}
  Q -->|"yes"| A["ACTIONS<br/>(registered: run() + permission;<br/>its file is in REGISTERED_ACTION_FILES)"]
  Q -->|"no, on purpose"| W["PALETTE_ALLOW_LIST<br/>(one reason each)"]
  Q -->|"no, not yet"| U["UNREGISTERED_ACTIONS<br/>(owed by an open epic; empty today)"]
```

If a file is in none of them, `action-registry.test.ts` fails with: `Dialog file(s) with no palette decision: client-admin/src/routes/_staff/x/-new-dialog.tsx. Fix: (1) register an action in ACTIONS and add its id to REGISTERED_ACTION_FILES, (2) add it to PALETTE_ALLOW_LIST with a reason, or (3) add it to UNREGISTERED_ACTIONS with an owning epic.`

Concrete example of the rule applied: Epic 21.0 adds `/routines/class`.
The wave-close ticket must (a) add it to the route manifest, (b) add it to
the nav tree under _Academics › Timetable & routines_, (c) register
"Open my routine" as a palette action, (d) add `en`/`bn` keys, (e) add a
workbook tab for `routine_slots`. Any of those missing fails CI, not code
review.

## 3. Navigation tree

Built from a full inventory (672 rows: the reference ERP's nav, its
permission catalogue of 169 controllers, the analysis report's 136
features, every existing SchoolManager route, every open epic). 657 rows placed,
15 deliberately excluded (vendor quiz game, application-menu registry,
mobile-app CMS pages, framework plumbing), 0 unplaced. Owners in brackets:
`have` exists today · `partial` exists but thinner than the reference ·
`19.0` etc. = open epic · `N2` etc. = new-epic candidate from the report.

Roles: **A** admin · **Ac** accountant · **E** executive · **T** teacher ·
**G** guardian · **S** student · **P** platform (super-admin).

Not in the nav on purpose (reached by a redirect, a link or a button):
`/welcome` (the setup wizard, opens once for an admin of an unfinished school),
`/register`, `/auth/social/done`, and `/staff/import` (a button on Staff).
The setup checklist is a card on the Dashboard, and the trial bar sits under
the top bar for admins only. See [22-onboarding.md](22-onboarding.md).

| P11 | Coaching centres reuse Class/Section, relabelled Course/Batch via tenant label overrides — not Programs.

| P12 | **My class** (Epic 47.0) lives under **Academics**, next to My routine. TEACHER only (`MY_CLASS_VIEW`). Routes `/my-class` and `/my-class/$sectionId`; palette actions `my-class.open` and `my-class.take-attendance` (`/my-class?then=attendance`). One section redirects straight to its page. A teacher with no class-teacher or assistant section sees "You are not a class teacher of any section yet — ask an admin." A section card shows a role badge (class teacher or assistant). Current academic year only. |

## 4. Command palette — `Ctrl/Cmd+K`

One component, three tabs. Each tab is a mode; the shortcut opens the
palette on _People_; `←`/`→` move between tabs, `Ctrl+1`/`Ctrl+2`/`Ctrl+3`
jump directly to People/Page/Action, and typing a prefix jumps to a mode
as a shortcut (`/` Page, `>` Action). **`Tab` deliberately keeps its native
browser meaning** rather than switching tabs — the palette's search input
is a `role="combobox"` that must keep focus for the whole interaction, and
binding `Tab` inside it would break the browser's own focus-trap-escape
that keyboard users rely on (`ui/src/components/command-palette.tsx`'s own
comment block spells this out). It is the whole palette:
`CommandPaletteLauncher` (`client-admin/src/components/command-palette-launcher.tsx`)
opens it from the top bar, and the old `global-search` files no longer exist.

**Action registry contract** — the only way an operation becomes invocable:

```ts
{
  id: 'payments.record',
  label: { en: 'Record payment', bn: '…' },
  permission: 'payments:create',          // same gating as the nav
  kind: 'modal' | 'navigate' | 'inline',
  context: ['student', 'guardian'],       // what it can prefill from
  run: (ctx) => …                          // opens the shared form or navigates
}
```

Rules: no field-count restriction on modal actions — a modal may hold a
whole flow (pick person → see applied fees → record). Modal actions render
the same form component as the page (U7). Every action carries i18n labels
in both locales. The actual list lives in
`client-admin/src/action-registry.ts` (`ACTIONS` — registered actions, each with
a `run()` and a permission that matches `STAFF_ROUTE_PERMISSIONS` or a listed
stricter exception) and `client-admin/src/unregistered-actions.ts`
(`PALETTE_ALLOW_LIST` — dialog files deliberately not in the palette, one reason
each — and `UNREGISTERED_ACTIONS` — dialogs deferred to an open epic). See the
three-list diagram in §2.

`run()` can land on a page with a one-shot search flag. Example: `classes.create`
runs `navigate({ to: '/classes?new=1' })`; the Classes page opens its create
dialog through the shared `useLandingFlag` hook, and closing the dialog clears
only `new`, so list filters survive.

## 5. Breadcrumbs

- Derived from the TanStack route tree, never hand-written per page.
- Entity segments show the entity name once loaded. While it loads, the crumb is a
  skeleton bar (`h-3 w-24 rounded-sm bg-muted`) — **never an id** (D9). The tab
  title (`document.title`) uses the parent label meanwhile.
- The crumb row renders only when the trail has **2 or more crumbs**. A top-level
  page starts at its `h1`.
- Every crumb but the last is a link. The trail also feeds `document.title` (`Fees · Rahim Uddin · SchoolManager`).
- Sits **above** the page title inside the shell header; on phones only the last two crumbs show.
- Identical placement and behaviour on every screen — staff, portal and platform.

## 7. Backup and restore coverage

Every epic that adds a tenant-scoped entity ships, in the wave-close ticket
of the wave that adds it: the workbook tab (export + restore), a round-trip
test (`server/test/workbook-roundtrip.integration.spec.ts` pattern), and
seed rows. The entity-level guard (§2) turns "forgot the tab" into a red
CI, and the allowlist (with a one-line reason per entry) is the only way
to opt an entity out. See [14-school-workbook.md](14-school-workbook.md).

## 8. What every epic must state

Three mandatory sections in every epic body (enforced by the `plan-epic`
skill template):

- **UX requirements** — where each screen lives (tree path from §3), the
  keyboard path for the primary task, palette actions it registers,
  breadcrumb shape, empty/error states, phone layout.
- **Backup & restore coverage** — entities added, their tabs, seed rows.
- **No-silent-gaps checklist** — route manifest, nav tree, action registry,
  i18n keys, workbook tab, seed: each ticked with the ticket that does it.

And one **UX round** in the grill (Phase 1): placement, keyboard path,
actions, breadcrumbs, empty states, phone — asked before decisions are
final, so UX is designed, not retrofitted.
