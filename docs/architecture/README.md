# SchoolManager Architecture Docs

This is the source of truth for how SchoolManager is actually built. It replaces
the old planning documents from before the system existed — those captured
the _original vision_; these docs describe _what was actually built_,
including every place implementation diverged from that original plan (and
why).

Each file below is self-contained — read only the one you need for the task
at hand instead of loading the whole set.

architecture, README covers the _how_ of working in the repo day to day.
