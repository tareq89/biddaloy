 * seed row set, once per spec *file* (called from `setup.ts`'s per-file
 * `beforeAll`, not its per-test `beforeEach`).
 *
 * These used to be reset implicitly, once per file, as a side effect of
 * `dataSource.dropDatabase()` + re-migrate + re-seed running in every
 * file's own `beforeAll`/`afterAll`. Stage 2 (`test/global-setup.ts`)
 * moved that migrate-and-seed cycle to run once per *run* instead of once
 * per *file*, for the ~340ms → ~6ms no-op win described there — but two
 * classes of spec file mutate these six tables directly and relied on
 * that per-file wipe for isolation:
 *
 * - Several e2e specs (e.g. `academic-years.e2e-spec.ts`,
 *   `auth.e2e-spec.ts`) `INSERT` an extra `user_tenants` row for the
 *   seeded admin, to test a second role, and never delete it themselves.
 * - Integration specs that build their own `TypeOrmModule` with
 *   `{ synchronize: true, dropSchema: true }` (e.g.
 *   `students.service.integration.spec.ts`) drop and rebuild the *entire*
 *   schema from entity metadata in their own `beforeAll`, then seed their
 *   own local fixtures into these tables. Note that this is schema-level
 *   damage, not just stray rows — `repairSchemaIfDamaged()` in `setup.ts`
 *   handles the part that re-inserting rows cannot fix.
 *
 * Without a per-file reset, both leak forward into whichever spec file
 * runs next in the same `vitest run` invocation — e.g. a stray extra
 * `user_tenants` row collides with `IDX_user_tenants_user_tenant_role`'s
 * unique constraint the next time some other file inserts the same
 * (user, tenant, role) tuple.
 *
 * This is *not* run per-test (unlike `buildResetSql()` above) because
 * some files intentionally create additional tenants/users in their own
 * `beforeAll` and mutate them across their own tests — e.g.
 * `cross-tenant-access.e2e-spec.ts`. Resetting every test would wipe
 * those out from under the file's own first test.
 *
 * The seed values are interpolated rather than passed as `$n` parameters
 * because Postgres's simple query protocol — the only one that accepts
 * several statements in a single round trip, which is the whole point of
 * building one string here — does not support bind parameters. That is
 * safe only because every interpolated value is a compile-time constant
 * from `test/constants.ts` (UUIDs, a fixed email, a bcrypt hash, none of
 * which contain a quote). Anything caller-supplied must not go in here.
