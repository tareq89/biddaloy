 * common/rate-limit/rate-limit-tracker.ts).
 *
 * The stricter per-route tier used on expensive endpoints (bulk upload, fee
 * generation, bulk reminders, invoice creation) is applied via `@Throttle()`
 * decorators with literal values instead: `@Throttle()` arguments are
 * evaluated at module-import time, before ConfigModule's dotenv loading runs,
 * so env-driven numbers there would silently miss `.env`-file overrides in
 * local dev (only already-present process env vars would take effect).
