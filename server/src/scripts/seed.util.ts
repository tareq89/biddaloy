/** [8.9.5] manual-testing aid: gives the seed admin a *second* school
 * membership so `/select-school`'s picker actually has something to show
 * — a single-membership account always skips it. Idempotent (safe to
 * call on every seed run, new account or existing one): finds-or-creates
 * both the school and the membership row rather than assuming either is
 * missing.
 *
 * Kept out of `seed.ts` (which runs `seed()` as an unconditional top-level
 * side effect against a real `NestFactory`-booted app) so it can be
 * unit-tested directly against mocked repositories in `seed.util.spec.ts`
 * — same split as `reencrypt-settings.ts`/`reencrypt-settings.util.ts`. */
