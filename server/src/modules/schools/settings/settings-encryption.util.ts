 * `decryptSecretFields`'s read path this is the thing persisting back to

 *
 * A value already under the current key passes through byte-for-byte
 * unchanged, rather than being decrypted and re-encrypted with a fresh
 * IV: `encryption.isCurrent` checks this without needing to touch
 * plaintext. That's what makes the migration script's own "did anything
