   * For every list (`shifts`/`versions`/`groups`):

   *
   * What the transaction actually buys: atomicity between the guard, the
   * rename's row rewrite, and the settings save — all three commit or
   * roll back together. It does **not** exclude a concurrent
   * `ClassService.create`/`update`: both read the tenant's vocabulary

   * transaction, so under read-committed a create/update can still commit
   * using a value this call just removed or renamed away from (the
   * create-vs-remove half is `ClassService.create`'s own known,
   * out-of-scope race; update-vs-rename is the same root cause).
   *
   * That window isn't microseconds either: `TenantSettingsCache` is
   * process-local with a 30s TTL, and `invalidate()` (called right after
   * this transaction commits) only clears *this* process's copy. On a
   * multi-replica deploy, a create/update served by a replica that didn't
   * handle this PATCH can keep validating against the pre-rename/removal
   * vocabulary for up to 30 real seconds afterward — no unlucky timing
   * required, just two replicas.
   * ponytail: no cross-table lock or cross-replica invalidation guards
   * this — revisit only if it actually produces a stale-vocabulary row a
   * customer hits.
