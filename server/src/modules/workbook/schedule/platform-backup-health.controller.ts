/**
 * [14.12.3/#617] `GET /platform/backups/health` — SUPER_ADMIN only. It
 * reads across every school rather than one tenant's data, but it still
 * runs the same guard chain as `SchoolsController` (the other cross-tenant
 * SUPER_ADMIN surface): `ContextGuard` requires *some* `X-Tenant-ID` to
 * build `request.currentTenant` for `RolesGuard`, and never applies that
 * tenant's suspension check to a SUPER_ADMIN (see `ContextGuard`'s own
 * comment) — so the caller's own tenant id is the expected value and has
 * no bearing on which schools this reports. Sending no header is a 401,
 * pinned by the e2e spec.
 *
 * One row per school: its current `backup.schedule` setting, the most
 * recent EXPORT job's outcome, the most recent *successful* EXPORT's
 * timestamp, and how much storage its kept backups (EXPORT + SNAPSHOT)
 * occupy. Scoped to `kind: EXPORT` deliberately — a SNAPSHOT is an
 * internal artefact `RestoreService` creates as a safety copy before a
 * restore, not itself a "backup" in the sense this table reports on, so
 * it is excluded from `last_status`/`last_success_at` but still counted
 * in `storage_total_bytes` (it occupies real storage against the same
 * per-tenant cap). A school that has never run an export backup gets
 * `last_success_at: null` / `last_status: null` — the "never" row
 * `BackupHealthTable` renders.
 *
 * Looped per school rather than one aggregate query: `findAll()` returns
 * every school (there is no pagination on this route, matching
 * `SchoolsController.list`), and platform tenant counts are small enough
 * that N+1 sequential lookups here are simpler to read and to test than a
 * hand-rolled `DISTINCT ON` query — worth revisiting if school counts ever
 * make this slow.
