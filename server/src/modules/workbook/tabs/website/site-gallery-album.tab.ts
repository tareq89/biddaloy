/**
 * [40.6.10] `site_gallery_albums`: the album folders of the school gallery (title and order).
 * Photos are not in the workbook: `site_gallery_photos` points at `site_media`, a file in the
 * storage backup, and a photo row without its file would only 404 (both are in `ENTITY_COVERAGE_EXEMPT`).
 * A restore therefore brings back empty albums for the admin to refill, and never deletes one
 * (`deleteByAbsence: false`): an album with photos is held by a RESTRICT foreign key, and one made
 * after the backup must survive it. The key is `sort_order`, which the gallery service keeps unique.
