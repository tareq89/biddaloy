 * `providers/`, and `entities/communication-log.entity.ts` are the exact
 * set of files that would move into a standalone notification service.
 *
 * Retries are at-least-once, not exactly-once: a crash between a
 * provider's successful send and this method recording it could resend on
 * the next attempt (the log's status guard at the top of `process` catches
 * a *replay after that save landed*, but not a crash *before* it commits).
 * Full send-idempotency would need provider-side dedup keys, which aren't
 * uniformly available across these gateways, so this narrow window is an
 * accepted tradeoff rather than something this module solves. `settle`
 * saving the log and recording the batch outcome in one transaction is what
 * keeps that window from also being able to strand a batch in PROCESSING —
 * either both commit, or neither does and the retry goes through the
 * normal path again.
