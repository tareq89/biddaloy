   * #3320: a send's HTTP status decides before its body. `undefined` for a 2xx (read the body).
   * 401/403 = the key was refused, 4xx = the message was refused: REJECTED, the credit is released.
   * 5xx = the vendor may have sent before failing: AMBIGUOUS, the credit stays held, and never
   * retried (a retry could send the SMS twice and pay the vendor twice). Reconciliation decides.
   * 408/429 stay REJECTED and permanent: no vendor here documents that they were not sent, so a
   * retry is not known to be safe.
   * `error` texts are fixed sentences (Rule 23); the vendor's body only goes in `raw`.
   *
   * Decision (review round 2 on #3347): an answer we cannot trust is never retried. That covers a
   * 5xx and a 2xx we cannot use (an unknown shape, or a body that is not JSON): the vendor may
   * have sent it. The cost is accepted on purpose: in a vendor-wide outage every row of a bulk
   * send ends FAILED with its credit held (`credit: 'UNSETTLED'`) until ops settle it by hand.
   * Automatic settling through the vendor's status API is follow-up #3353. The one retried
   * failure left is a thrown network error or timeout (`retryAfterThrow`).
