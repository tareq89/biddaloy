 * caught internally and returned as `{ success: false, error }` so the
 * processor always gets a result to persist onto the CommunicationLog row.
 *
 * `tenantId` (#8.7.10) is what each provider resolves its own config
 * against — `TenantProviderConfigResolver`, not `ConfigService` directly
 * — so two tenants using different accounts for the same medium never
 * share state. Callers always have it: `CommunicationsProcessor` loads
 * the `CommunicationLog` row before dispatching and reads `tenant_id`
 * off it, the same column every other tenant-scoped query in this
 * codebase filters on.
