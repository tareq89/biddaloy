/**
 * Frontend test workspace — `shared`, `ui`, `client-admin`. Two
 * environments per package, kept as separate leaf projects (Vitest doesn't
 * allow nesting `projects` inside a referenced project, so "one config per
 * package with an inner node/jsdom split" isn't expressible — each
 * package×environment pair has to be its own top-level entry):
 *
 *   - `<pkg>:node` — no DOM. Pure logic: formatting, permission resolution,
 *     validation, arithmetic. `*.spec.ts`. A test here that imports React
 *     and tries to render fails outright — there is no `document` — and
 *     that's deliberate: it's the boundary between "logic" and "component"
 *     tests, enforced by the environment rather than a lint rule.
 *   - `<pkg>:jsdom` — component/hook tests with React Testing Library.
 *     `*.test.{ts,tsx}`.
 *
 * Path aliases below mirror each package's real `vite.config.ts`/
 * `tsconfig.json` `paths` by hand, rather than importing those files —
 * `vitest`'s own config loader bundles against a *different, nested* Vite
 * major (`vitest/node_modules/vite`) than the one `client-admin`'s own
 * `vite.config.ts` runs against (root `vite`), and
 * importing one from the other breaks on a `defineConfig` interop error
 * across the version gap. The Vite plugins those files load (`@vitejs/
 * plugin-react`, `@tailwindcss/vite`) exist for dev/build — Fast Refresh,
 * the Tailwind CSS pipeline — neither of which a test run needs; esbuild
 * (already in Vite's default pipeline) transforms JSX on its own by
 * reading each package's `tsconfig.json` `jsx` setting.
 *
 * `server/vitest.config.ts` is untouched and unrelated — the server runs
 * its own Vitest invocation from `server/`, this file only covers the
 * frontend packages.

// a node-tier test can call auth-state's setters directly (permission
// resolution, say) without ever touching renderWithProviders, and should
// get the same cleanup guarantee.

// [15.1] Set only by ci.yml's per-job collect step (`CI_TIMINGS_OUT=<path>`
// on the test command's env). Unset — every local run, and every job that
// hasn't been wired up — means zero behaviour change: `reporters` below is
// simply omitted and Vitest keeps its own default. Verified: setting
// `test.reporters` at the *top level* of a `projects`-mode config works
// (unlike `testTimeout`, which projects silently ignore when set only at
// the top level — see PROJECT_TEST_TIMEOUT's own comment below).
const timingsOut = process.env.CI_TIMINGS_OUT;

// [18.5.1] A `--shard=N/3` run only sees ~1/3 of the suite, so it can never
// meet the whole-suite thresholds below on its own — enforcing them per
// shard makes every shard fail regardless of real coverage. Thresholds are
// only meaningful (and only enabled) against the merged report that
// `frontend-merge`'s `--merge-reports` run produces, which carries no
// `--shard` flag.

// eslint-rules/component-boundary.spec.mjs's type-aware RuleTester cases
// (already the slowest tests here, since they run real TypeScript
// type-checking) went from ~700ms locally to timing out at the 5000ms
// default in CI once `--coverage` was wired in there ([8.3.5]). Not a
// flaky test — reproducible, coverage-only slowdown on a slower CI CPU.
// Set per-project (Vitest's `projects` mode does not inherit a top-level
// `test.testTimeout` into each project — a top-level setting here is
// silently ignored), applied to every project rather than just `ui:node`:
// harmless headroom elsewhere, and the one project that needs it doesn't
// get its own easy-to-forget bespoke value.
const PROJECT_TEST_TIMEOUT = 20_000;

// [15.3] Vitest 4 defaults to the `forks` pool. `threads` is real, free
// money here: 61.7s vs 69.4s wall (measured locally, coverage off, over
// the 201-file suite) with every test still green — no test-code change, no isolation
// trade-off. Set per-project, same as `PROJECT_TEST_TIMEOUT` above and for
// the same reason: a top-level `test.pool` is *not* inherited into
// `projects` mode either — verified empirically (a run with only the
// top-level key set still showed `workers/forks.js` in `ps -ef` for every
// worker process; only setting it per-project switched them to
// `workers/threads.js`).
const PROJECT_POOL = 'threads' as const;

// [18.3.2] CI's frontend job runs on a 4 vCPU runner. Left unset, Vitest
// computes `maxWorkers` from `os.availableParallelism()` (falling back to
// `os.cpus().length`) **per project** — each of the six top-level
// `projects` entries below independently sizes its own pool off the same
// 4-core host. Pinning it to 4 here does NOT cap the total worker count
// across the whole run (six projects × 4 worker threads each is still up
// to 24 worker threads queued onto 4 cores — Vitest's `projects`
// mode has no shared, cross-project worker budget to pin instead). What
// this *does* fix: it removes the ambiguity of an unset default that can
// silently size differently under `--coverage` (Vitest 4 has been
// observed to compute pool size differently there) or on a
// differently-sized runner, so every project gets the same explicit,
// intentional number instead of an environment-dependent guess. The
// deeper cross-project oversubscription problem this ticket set out to
// explain (604s work / 434s wall, 1.4x parallelism) is a `projects`-mode
// architecture limit, not something `maxWorkers` here resolves — flagged
// as a residual for 18.5.1's sharding call. Not measured against a real
// CI push — this worktree has no push access to trigger one (see
// README's "Runner settings" table) — so this is the locally-reasoned
// half of [18.3.2]'s options, not a measured ≥5% win.
const PROJECT_MAX_WORKERS = 4;

// [15.3] `isolate: false` runs every test file in a project inside the same
// worker/module registry instead of a fresh one each time — real speedup
// (measured ~2.9s wall / ~26.4 CPU-s off the four `:node` projects
// combined), but it trades "each file starts clean" for "files sharing a
// worker share module state". Safe here specifically because these four
// projects have **zero** `vi.mock()` calls between them — checked across
// all six include globs (`ui/src/**/*.spec.ts`, `ui/eslint-rules/**`,
// `ui/scripts/**`, `client-admin/src/**/*.spec.ts`, `shared/src/**`,
// `scripts/**/*.spec.mjs`), and now enforced on every run by
// `scripts/no-vi-mock-in-node-specs.spec.mjs` rather than left as a comment
// that quietly stops being true. Two other shared-registry hazards do exist
// there and are safe only because they clean up after themselves:
// `ui/src/hooks/retry.spec.ts` (`vi.stubGlobal` + `vi.unstubAllGlobals`) and
// `ui/src/api/session.spec.ts` (fake timers + `vi.useRealTimers`) — nothing hoists a fake module for a later file in
// the same worker to inherit. The `:jsdom` projects are NOT given this
// setting: they DO have `vi.mock()` users, and turning this on there
// reproduces two independent kinds of cross-file contamination — fake
// timers leaking past a file that forgets `vi.useRealTimers()`, and (found
// while investigating this ticket) a partial `vi.mock('@biddaloy/ui/api')`
// in `client-admin/src/main.sentry-wiring.test.ts` that omits
// `ensureSessionLoaded`, which then poisons the *real* module's consumers
// (`select-school.test.tsx`, `_staff/invoices/$invoiceId.test.tsx`) when
// they share a worker with it. Fixing every `vi.mock()` user to tolerate a
// shared registry is real work across 7 files — out of scope for this
// ticket, and NOT yet filed as an issue (don't read "follow-up" as "someone
// is on it"). It is the only remaining lever on #438's own ~80s target, so
// it needs filing under epic #428. See README's "Frontend Testing" section.
