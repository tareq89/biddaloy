# Reads EDGE_MODE and writes the parts of the config that differ between the two
# ways the origin can be reached (Epic 79.0, D8):
#
#   tunnel  cloudflared dials in over the `biddaloy-edge` network, plain HTTP on :80.
#           The visitor address comes from CF-Connecting-IP, but only from the trusted
#           subnet EDGE_TRUSTED_CIDR (required, pinned by the deploy); no TLS lines, no basic auth
#           (Cloudflare Access is the outer login, checked by cloudflared). The app is told
#           the public scheme is https.
#   direct  80/443 are published. Let's Encrypt certificate, :80 only answers ACME and
#           redirects, the visitor address is the TCP peer (no real_ip lines at all),
#           protected hosts ask for basic auth ($basic_auth), HSTS on.
#
# Output (the templates include/read these):
#   conf.d/00-edge.conf               $basic_auth, $edge_redirect, $edge_proto, $edge_hsts,
#                                     resolver (+ real_ip in tunnel)
#   snippets/edge-server.conf         inside every named server: TLS listen + ACME + :80 redirect
#   snippets/edge-default.conf        inside the catch-all server: TLS handshake reject
#
# Any bad value stops the container: a loud failure beats a silently wrong trust model.
