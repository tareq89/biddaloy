/**
 * Gate CI on `yarn audit`. Two modes:
 *
 *   node scripts/ci-audit.js               all deps, fails on high/critical
 *                                          (dev tooling noise stays out)
 *   node scripts/ci-audit.js --production  production deps only
 *                                          (`--groups dependencies`), fails on
 *                                          moderate or worse: this code ships
 *                                          to users, so the bar is lower.
 *
 * An allowlist entry absent from a run is only printed as a note: a
 * dev-only entry is legitimately missing from the production run.
 *
 * Yarn 1's `--level` flag only filters what's printed — the process exit
 * code is a bitmask of every severity found (info=1, low=2, moderate=4,
 * high=8, critical=16), regardless of `--level`. A single low-severity
 * advisory would otherwise fail this job. This script re-implements the
 * filter correctly by reading `--json` output and only failing on
 * high/critical entries not present in ALLOWLIST below.
 *
 * Allowlisted advisories must carry a reason and a re-check date. The date
 * is enforced below, not just documentation — once it passes, this script
 * fails the job until someone re-reviews and picks a new date, so the
 * exception can't silently outlive its review window.
