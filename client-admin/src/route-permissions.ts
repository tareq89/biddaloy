/**
 * [8.14.17]'s one map: every staff route's TanStack **route ID** (not
 * path — index routes carry a trailing slash, `/_staff/students/`, and
 * `routes/_staff.tsx` wraps this in `RequirePermission` per route match)
 * to the single permission that route needs.
 *
 * The value type is deliberately non-optional (`Permission`, never
 * `undefined`) — "no gate" is not an expressible value here. A route
 * added later without an entry fails `route-permissions.test.ts`'s drift
 * guard rather than silently rendering to everyone.
 *
 * Every route gets **blanket refusal matching nav visibility** — the
 * same permission `_staff.tsx`'s nav item (or, where a route has no nav
 * item of its own, its data) already gates on. No route ships a
 * reduced-but-still-visible read-only view in this ticket: that would
 * require *granting* a permission (e.g. `INVOICE_READ` to `EXECUTIVE`)
 * in `shared/src/enums/permissions.ts`'s `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, a product
 * decision this client-only ticket does not make. See `docs/architecture
 * /frontend.md`'s route-access section for the full table and that
 * decision's writeup.
