/**
 * [30.1.5] The allowlist for `nav-tree.test.ts`'s Direction A guard: every
 * leaf route in `routeTree.gen.ts` must either resolve through
 * `STAFF_NAV_GROUPS`/`STAFF_NAV_ITEMS`, or have a one-line reason here for
 * why it legitimately has no sidebar home. Copies
 * `registry.completeness.spec.ts`'s "reason required" convention
 * (`server/src/modules/workbook/codec/registry.ts`'s `excluded`) — a typo'd
 * route id here would silently mean "we don't need this in the sidebar,"
 * the same failure mode `route-permissions.test.ts` closes for permissions.
 *
 * Keyed by the route's `id` in `router.routesById` (the same id
 * `route-permissions.test.ts` uses), not by URL path.
