/**
 * [31.5.1b / D35] The other half of the action registry's contract.
 *
 * Every file under `client-admin/src/routes` that holds dialog markup
 * (`<Dialog`, `DialogContent`, `<Sheet`, `SheetContent`, `<FullPageShell`)
 * must end up in exactly one of three places. `action-registry.test.ts`
 * fails the build for a file that is in none of them.
 *
 * 1. Registered: a palette action in `ACTIONS` opens it (its file is listed in
 *    `REGISTERED_ACTION_FILES` in `action-registry.test.ts`).
 * 2. Allow-listed (`PALETTE_ALLOW_LIST`): a permanent decision that it does not
 *    belong in `Ctrl+K`, with a one-line reason. No owning epic: nothing is owed.
 * 3. Deferred (`UNREGISTERED_ACTIONS`): "wire this later", with the open epic
 *    that owes it. Empty today.
 *
 * Both lists are keyed by the **dialog file**, never by the page that hosts it.
 * Adding a dialog? Register it, allow-list it with a reason, or defer it.
